"5N9C9VID","journalArticle","2020","Schneider, Jodi; Ye, Di; Hill, Alison M.; Whitehorn, Ashley S.","Continued post-retraction citation of a fraudulent clinical trial report, 11 years after it was retracted for falsifying data.","Scientometrics","","01389130","","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lxh&AN=147251388&site=ehost-live","This paper presents a case study of long-term post-retraction citation to falsified clinical trial data (Matsuyama et al. in Chest 128(6):3817–3827, 2005. https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.128.6.3817), demonstrating problems with how the current digital library environment communicates retraction status. Eleven years after its retraction, the paper continues to be cited positively and uncritically to support a medical nutrition intervention, without mention of its 2008 retraction for falsifying data. To date no high quality clinical trials reporting on the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids on reducing inflammatory markers have been published. Our paper uses network analysis, citation context analysis, and retraction status visibility analysis to illustrate the potential for extended propagation of misinformation over a citation network, updating and extending a case study of the first 6 years of post-retraction citation (Fulton et al. in Publications 3(1):7–26, 2015. https://doi.org/10.3390/publications3010017). The current study covers 148 direct citations from 2006 through 2019 and their 2542 second-generation citations and assesses retraction status visibility of the case study paper and its retraction notice on 12 digital platforms as of 2020. The retraction is not mentioned in 96% (107/112) of direct post-retraction citations for which we were able to conduct citation context analysis. Over 41% (44/107) of direct post-retraction citations that do not mention the retraction describe the case study paper in detail, giving a risk of diffusing misinformation from the case paper. We analyze 152 second-generation citations to the most recent 35 direct citations (2010–2019) that do not mention the retraction but do mention methods or results of the case paper, finding 23 possible diffusions of misinformation from these non-direct citations to the case paper. Link resolving errors from databases show a significant challenge in a reader reaching the retraction notice via a database search. Only 1/8 databases (and 1/9 database records) consistently resolved the retraction notice to its full-text correctly in our tests. Although limited to evaluation of a single case (N = 1), this work demonstrates how retracted research can continue to spread and how the current information environment contributes to this problem.

Women, in particular, are becoming victims of hostilities on the digital scenario. This problem is currently known as ""digital sexism"" and ""gender disinformation"". In this context, verification journalism, a trendy format, aims to reduce the effects of hoaxes introducing the fact-checking process in its professional routines. However, this is still a minority task. In order to contribute to the study of the disinformation phenomenon in relation to online messages about women, this research has developed a systematic tool to classify hoaxes that have been refuted by the platform Maldita.es, specifically, on its sections Maldito Feminismo (N=71). This tool, inspired by the taxonomies created by Derakhshan & Wardle (2017), Tandoc, Lim & Ling (2018) and Molina, Sundar, Le & Lee (2019), allows you to categorize fake news according to the type of information disorder, the agent, the message and the interpreter. The results of this study (internal validity) show that hoaxes detected by Maldito Feminismo are misleading content that expect to damage feminism (this is the main topic of fake news) and have a political purpose. These information disorders are displayed in text format and are mainly created and distributed on social networks. Moreover, although users collaborate and participate detecting and reporting hoaxes, the platform Maldito Feminismo identifies, locates and denounces most of the fake news.

However, researchers have rarely investigated their diffusion in non-western contexts. This study aims to systematically examine the content and network structure of rumor-related discussions around genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on Chinese social media. Design/methodology/approach: This study identified 21,837 rumor-related posts of GMOs on Weibo, one of China's most popular social media platforms. An approach combining social network analysis and content analysis was employed to classify user attitudes toward rumors, measure the level of homophily of their attitudes and examine the nature of their interactions. Findings: Though a certain level of homophily existed in the interaction networks, referring to the observed echo chamber effect, Weibo also served as a public forum for GMO discussions in which cross-cutting ties between communities existed. A considerable amount of interactions emerged between the pro- and anti-GMO camps, and most of them involved providing or requesting information, which could mitigate the likelihood of opinion polarization. Moreover, this study revealed the declining role of traditional opinion leaders and pointed toward the need for alternative strategies for efficient fact-checking. Originality/value: In general, the findings of this study suggested that microblogging platforms such as Weibo can function as public forums for discussing GMOs that expose users to ideologically cross-cutting viewpoints. This study stands to provide important insights into the viral processes of scientific rumors on social media.

Networked civic monitoring of populist radical right online action in Finland.","Information, Communication & Society","","1369118X","","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=lxh&AN=144953143&site=ehost-live","This article analyses civic monitoring that targets online radical right populist anti-immigration activism in Finland to discuss whether outsourcing monitoring to platform users is a feasible means to respond to exclusionary-populist online communication. For several reasons, the widely discussed – and potentially harmful – phenomena related to the emancipation of radical right populist online counterpublics have proved difficult to control. First of all, using exclusionary and antagonistic rhetoric or spreading disinformation is not illegal, which makes policing it ineffective. Second, journalistic scrutiny tends to increase the salience of radical right agendas without significantly curbing their appeal. Third, social media companies have passed down responsibility for monitoring extremism on their platforms to users. As an option, it has been suggested that users could organize to push potentially harmful content to the margins of online publics. The study reveals that the materiality of online anti-immigration action allows it to be monitored by anti-racist activists to a certain extent, and that online action aimed at resisting online radical right activism ranges from civil counter-arguing and pursuing of deliberation to anti-racist hate speech and naming-and-shaming campaigns. There are notable caveats that undermine the efficacy and viability of civic monitoring as a means of watching over radical right populist online action. The main problems are related to the connective and potentially anti-populist nature of the civic monitoring – allowing it to be counter-surveilled and used as fuel for populist online communication – and potential danger and harm to the activists involved.

To investigate fake news during natural disasters, this mixed-methods study examines information patterns and journalistic practices of three news organizations during the 2018 Palu earthquake and tsunami. First, online observations of disaster-related fake news cases on social media provide insights into how fake news was handled by three types of news media. The results show that when fake news concerned factual scientific evidence, news organizations unanimously used the government statements to debunk disinformation. In contrast, political or religious fake news had long lifecycles of polarized debates between pro-government groups and opponents. Using the Hierarchy-of Influences Model, in-depth interviews showed that individual-level journalistic professionalism mattered when tackling fake news reports, with some local practices differing from Western journalism approaches. At the routine level, news professionals treated the government as the authority to debunk controversial, high-risk fake news by presenting news only after official clarifications, while independent media tended to present balanced reports with diverse views. Additionally, interviewees revealed that organizational policies in relation to media types greatly influenced the handling of fake news practices in Indonesian newsrooms.

This study uses an experimental design on a national sample to test two features of user-based correction strategies on Instagram for a divisive issue on which misinformation abounds: the issue of climate change. First, we unite the inoculation and correction literature to test the efficacy of prebunking corrections that come before exposure to the misinformation versus debunking strategies that occur after exposure. Second, we compare fact-focused corrections that provide accurate information to rebut the misinformation against logic-focused corrections that highlight the rhetorical flaw underpinning the misinformation. Our findings suggest that these strategies intersect to reduce misperceptions. Logic-focused corrections effectively reduce misperceptions regardless of their placement before or after the misinformation, and appear to function in part by reducing perceptions of the credibility of the misinformation post. Fact-focused corrections only reduce misperceptions when they occur after the misinformation, but are seen as more credible than logic-focused corrections. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the theoretical mechanism by which correction can occur and the practical guidelines to best correct misinformation in visual social media spaces.

Traditionally, public service announcements (PSAs) consisted of video or radio messages, posters, or billboards created by government agencies and health organizations to provide information about health topics. However, the widespread use of the internet and the growth of social media has changed PSA creation and dissemination in many ways. Increasingly, a variety of actors, including non-official sources and lay persons, have been using social media to disseminate PSAs or PSA-like content. Audiences are larger and more engaged with content, and users have the novel ability to interact with PSAs through shares, likes, or comments. While social media for health communication has many advantages, there are also a number of disadvantages including misinformation, conspiracy theories, bots, and trolls. Credibility of different sources has also become a topic of debate. An ongoing challenge during the pandemic has been reaching audiences in a crowded online environment, establishing authority as a trusted source, and countering misinformation. In this paper, we discuss how the media landscape is changing PSAs and the implications of these changes in the context of pandemics.

It is important for public health professionals to better understand how and what information is being disseminated to correct non-evidence-based and potentially misleading information. This study was designed to provide a better understanding of the social-networking habits of ecigarette users who visit online e-cigarette forums. E-cigarette users were recruited from the ""e-cigarette forum"" website and completed an online survey inquiring about their use of Facebook, Twitter, and other social-networking websites. The survey inquired about participants' ecigarette postings to each site and whether their posts portrayed an ecigarette as positive, neutral, or negative. A total of 154 surveys were completed. Approximately 89% of respondents had created Facebook accounts, and 86% of those who posted comments to Facebook posted positively regarding e-cigarettes. Twitter accounts were reported by 55% of respondents, and 87% of those who posted indicated their posts were positive. YouTube was visited by 93% of respondents, and 94% of those who posted reported the posts as being positive. Possession of an account on another social-networking website was reported by 19% of respondents, and 100% of those who posted reported positive postings. Social media is popular among e-cigarette users who visit online ecigarette forums. Many users tend to post positive information regarding their e-cigarette use. Understanding this behavior better allows professionals to prepare themselves for correcting potentially misleading information presented on these sites.

This systematic review examines the available evidence supporting and refuting the use of social media in communicating with the public during the pandemic outbreaks of infectious disease, influencing people's behavior, spreading the awareness, and creating or dispelling rumors. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched from 2012 till 2019 for studies on the use of social media in detecting the following EIDs: the Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah virus, West Nile, Bird flu and Swine flu. The included studies were evaluated and data were extracted and reviewed. Results: Preliminary search results showed that out of 6224 articles related to social media and EIDs, 49 articles were related to our study objectives. Out of 49 articles, most of the articles were related to the Zika virus (n=24), published in 2017 (n=15) and utilized the Twitter social media (n=26).

It was reported that rumors were hampering the response effort. We sought to identify any rumors that could have influenced outbreak containment and affected prevention in unaffected areas of DR Congo. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study in DR Congo over a period of 2 months (from August 1 to September 30, 2019) using in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). The participants were recruited from five regional blocks using purposeful sampling. Both areas currently undergoing outbreaks and presently unaffected areas were included. We collected participants' opinions, views, and beliefs about the Ebola virus. The IDIs (n = 60) were performed with key influencers (schoolteachers, religious and political leaders/analysts, and Ebola-frontline workers), following a semi-structured interview guide. FGDs (n = 10) were conducted with community members. Interviews were recorded with a digital voice recorder and simultaneous note-taking. Participant responses were categorized in terms of their themes and subthemes. Results: We identified 3 high-level themes and 15 subthemes (given here in parentheses): (1) inadequate knowledge of the origin or cause of Ebola (belief in a metaphysical origin, insufficient awareness of Ebola transmission via an infected corpse, interpretation of disease as God's punishment, belief in nosocomial Ebola, poor hygiene, and bathing in the Congo River). Ebola was interpreted as (2) a plot by multinational corporations (fears of genocide, Ebola understood as a biological weapon, concerns over organ trafficking, and Ebola was taken to be the result of business actions). Finally Ebola was rumored to be subject to (3) politicization (political authorities seen as ambivalent, exclusion of some community leaders from response efforts, distrust of political authorities, and distrust in the healthcare system). Conclusions: Due to the skepticism against Ebola countermeasures, it is critical to understand widespread beliefs about the disease to implement actions that will be effective, including integrating response with the unmet needs of the population.

Here, so-called 'fake news' are of focus. These are considered problematic, particularly in a high-choice media environment as users tend to show selective behaviour. Much research has demonstrated this selective exposure approach, which has roots in the Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (Festinger, 1957). However, research on the processes of coping with dissonance is still considered sparse. In particular, communication scholars have overlooked emotional states and negotiations. This article analyses the affects that are aroused when users are confronted with opinion-challenging disinformation and how they (emotionally) cope by using different strategies for online information. For this, we used the context of climate change that is widely accepted in Germany. The innovative research design included pre- and post-survey research, stimulus exposure (denying 'fake news'), observations, and retrospective interviews (n = 50). Through this, we find that perceptions and coping strategies vary individually and that overt behaviour, such as searching for counter-arguments, should be seen against the background of individual ideas and motivations, such as believing in an easy rejection of arguments.

There has been a corresponding increase in research aimed at understanding opinions and beliefs that are expressed online. However, the generalizability of findings from social media research is a subject of ongoing debate. Social media platforms are conduits of both information and misinformation about vaccines and vaccine hesitancy. Our research objective was to examine whether we can draw similar conclusions from Twitter and national survey data about the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and a broader set of beliefs. In 2018 we conducted a nationally representative survey of parents in the United States informed by a literature review to ask their views on a range of topics, including vaccine side effects, conspiracy theories, and understanding of science. We developed a set of keyword-based queries corresponding to each of the belief items from the survey and pulled matching tweets from 2017. We performed the data pull of the most recent full year of data in 2018. Our primary measures of belief covariation were the loadings and scores of the first principal components obtained using principal component analysis (PCA) from the two sources. We found that, after using manually coded weblinks in tweets to infer stance, there was good qualitative agreement between the first principal component loadings and scores using survey and Twitter data. This held true after we took the additional processing step of resampling the Twitter data based on the number of topics that an individual tweeted about, as a means of correcting for differential representation for elicited (survey) vs. volunteered (Twitter) beliefs. Overall, the results show that analyses using Twitter data may be generalizable in certain contexts, such as assessing belief covariation.

To report on vaccine opposition and misinformation promoted on Twitter, highlighting Twitter accounts that drive conversation. Methods. We used supervised machine learning to code all Twitter posts. We first identified codes and themes manually by using a grounded theoretical approach and then applied them to the full data set algorithmically. We identified the top 50 authors month-over-month to determine influential sources of information related to vaccine opposition. Results. The data collection period was June 1 to December 1, 2019, resulting in 356 594 mentions of vaccine opposition. A total of 129 Twitter authors met the qualification of a top author in at least 1 month. Top authors were responsible for 59.5% of vaccine-opposition messages. We identified 10 conversation themes. Themes were similarly distributed across top authors and all other authors mentioning vaccine opposition. Top authors appeared to be highly coordinated in their promotion of misinformation within themes. Conclusions. Public health has struggled to respond to vaccine misinformation. Results indicate that sources of vaccine misinformation are not as heterogeneous or distributed as it may first appear given the volume of messages. There are identifiable upstream sources of misinformation, which may aid in countermessaging and public health surveillance.

These rates may be influenced by limited diffusion of evidence-based research and guidelines from the scientific community (SC). As recently highlighted by the National Academy of Sciences, there is a need for the SC to diffuse its findings to the public more effectively online, as means to counteract the spread of misinformation. In response to this call, we gathered data from Twitter for one month from major breastfeeding hashtags resulting in an interconnected social network (n = 3,798 users). We then identified 59 influencers who disproportionately influenced information flow using social network analysis. These influencers were from the SC (e.g. academics, researchers, health care practitioners), as well as interested citizens (IC) and companies. We then conducted an ego-network analysis of influencer networks, developed ego maps, and compared diffusion metrics across the SC, IC and company influencers. We also qualitatively analyzed their tweets (n = 711) to understand the type of information being diffused. SC influencers were the least efficient communicators. Although having the highest tweeting activity (80% of tweets), they did not reach more individuals compared to IC and companies (two-step ego size: 220± 99, 188 ± 124, 169 ± 97 respectively, P = 0.28). Content analysis of tweets suggest IC are more active than the SC in diffusing evidence-based breastfeeding knowledge, with 35% of their tweets around recent research findings compared to only 12% by the SC. Nonetheless, in terms of outreach to the general public, the two-step networks of SC influences were more heterogenous than ICs (55.7 ± 5.07, 50.9 ± 12.0, respectively, P<0.001). Collectively, these findings suggest SC influencers may possess latent potential to diffuse research and evidence- based practices. However, the research suggests specific ways to enhance diffusion.

Recently, however, the worrying proliferation of illegal or otherwise unwarranted content, fi'om copyright infringement to fake news to hate speech to terrorist propaganda, is triggering calls to abolish the safe harbor. The rhetoric is rather straightforward: platforms benefit from the sharing of content, they have the power to efficiently and effectively guard against illicit content, and if held liable for users' content they will act to address the spread of illegal content. Inflaming this rhetoric is a widespread understanding that platforms might have become too powerful and that in practice they Imve become the new online governors. Focusing on the recent confrontation of the safe harbor in copyright law, we show that debates on platform liability are at times heavy on rhetoric but light on facts. They have sometimes overlooked the consequences of abolishing the safe harbor and failed to question whether introducing liability could achieve a desirable outcome. Using the example of the music industry's call to amend copyright safe harbor because it has allegedly generated a ""value gap, "" this paper aims to demonstrate the dangers of designing policy based on unsubstantiated and populist rhetoric. The paper analyzes the value gap debate and debunks the allegations of right holders claiming that they generate insufficient income from digital platforms which reduces their incentives to create. While creators might have legitimate claims regarding a drop in their revenues, misleading rhetoric that remains unchecked might lead to misguided policy. At a macro level, our findings suggest that it is not necessarily the safe harbor that should be blamed for the worrying power concentration in todays' platform economy and that populist allegations must be verified carefidly before being acted upon.

Findings from a survey of 511 Chinese respondents suggest that, overall, individuals would perceive themselves to be less vulnerable than close others and distant others to the impact of COVID-19 digital disinformation. The highest self-other perceptual discrepancy is found when individuals receive disinformation on mobile social networking apps. Also, individuals who practice more active fact-checking perceive themselves to be less susceptible. The perception of disinformation effects on self as well as the self-other perceptual discrepancy is both positively related to emotional responses (anxiety, fear, and worry) to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study contributes to existing research by linking exposure to disinformation in different digital channels, the TPEs, and emotional outcomes in the context of a public health crisis. It also highlights the importance of educating and enabling fact-checking behaviors on digital media, which could help to reduce negative emotional impact of the disinformation.

CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS AND THE BEHAVIOR OF FREE AND PAID APPS.","Berkeley Technology Law Journal","","10863818","","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=144762546&site=ehost-live","""Paid"" digital services have been touted as straightforward alternatives to the ostensibly ""free"" model, in which users actually face a high price in the form of personal data, with limited awareness of the real cost incurred and little ability to manage their privacy preferences. Yet, the actual privacy behavior of paid services, and consumer expectations about that behavior, remain largely unknown. This Article addresses that gap. It presents empirical data both comparing the true cost of ""paid"" services as compared to their so-called ""free"" counterparts, and documenting consumer expectations about the relative behaviors of each. We first present an empirical study that documents and compares the privacy behaviors of 5,877 Android apps that are offered both as free and paid versions. The sophisticated analysis tool we employed, AppCensus, allowed us to detect exactly which sensitive user data is accessed by each app and with whom it is shared. Our results show that paid apps often share the same implementation characteristics and resulting behaviors as their free counterparts. Thus, if users opt to pay for apps to avoid privacy costs, in many instances they do not receive the benefit of the bargain. Worse, we find that there are no obvious cues that consumers can use to determine when the paid version of a free app offers better privacy protections than its free counterpart. We complement this data with a second study: we surveyed 1,000 Android mobile app users as to their perceptions of the privacy behaviors of paid and free app versions. Participants indicated that consumers are more likely to expect the paid version to engage in privacy-protective practices, to demonstrate transparency with regard to its data collection and sharing behaviors, and to offer more granular control over the collection of user data in that context. Together, these studies identify ways in which the actual behavior of apps fails to comport with users' expectations, and the way that representations of an app as ""paid"" or ""ad-free"" can mislead users. They also raise questions about the salience of those expectations for consumer choices. In light of this combined research, we then explore three sets of ramifications for policy and practice. First, our findings that paid services often conduct equally extensive levels of data collection and sale as free ones challenge understandings about how the ""pay for privacy"" model operates in practice, its promise as a privacy-protective alternative, and the legality of paid app behavior. Second, our findings offer important insights for legal approaches to privacy protection, undermining the legitimacy of legal regimes relying on fictive ""notice"" and ""consent"" that do not reflect user understandings as bases for the collection, sale, and processing of information. They fortify demands for a privacy law that focuses on vindicating actual consumer expectations and prohibiting practices that exploit them, and strengthen the argument for ex ante regulation of exploitative data practices where consumers are offered no opportunity for meaningful choice or consent. Third, our work provides technical tools for offering transparency about app behaviors, empowering consumers and regulators, law enforcement, consumer protections organizations, and private parties seeking to remedy undesirable or illegal privacy behavior in the most dominant example of a free vs. paid market--mobile apps--where there turns out to be no real privacy-protective option.

While previous research on online disinformation has focused on the individual level, the current study aims to shed light on cross-national differences. It compares online disinformation re-published by fact checkers from four Western democracies (the US, the UK, Germany, and Austria). The findings reveal significant differences between English-speaking and German-speaking countries. In the US and the UK, the largest shares of partisan disinformation are found, while in Germany and Austria sensationalist stories prevail. Moreover, in English-speaking countries, disinformation frequently attacks political actors, whereas in German-speaking countries, immigrants are most frequently targeted. Across all of the countries, topics of false stories strongly mirror national news agendas. Based on these results, the paper argues that online disinformation is not only a technology-driven phenomenon but also shaped by national information environments.

Methods  A 15-item questionnaire was administered during a face-to-face interview with 1,440 parents (88.1% women, median age: 32 years) whose children were followed up and treated in pediatric outpatient and/or inpatient clinics between July and September 2019. The influential factors on parental V-HR were statistically analyzed. Results  The majority of the parents were in favor of vaccination without doubt (n  = 1,184, 82.2%). The overall V-HR rate was 17.8%, with 16% of the parents (n  = 230) expressing hesitancy and 1.8% (n  = 26) completely refusing vaccination. Educational status significantly affected V-HR (p  = 0.001), with a higher proportion of V-HR parents having a higher educational level (high school–university) than those having a lower educational status. The prevalence of V-HR was significantly higher among parents who drew vaccination-related information from written, visual, and social media (p  < 0.001). Among the 256 parents, parental V-HR most commonly arose from perceived risk and safety concerns, with the feeling that vaccines might lead to another disease such as autism (57%), and the fear that vaccines might cause side effects (33%). Conclusion  Parental V-HR has transformed into an alarming global health problem. Of particular importance is monitoring and assessing parental V-HR in every aspect, particularly the media sources that continuously disseminate misinformation about vaccination. Besides nationwide projects to encourage vaccination, appropriate utilization of the same media sources is needed to counteract V-HR and enhance awareness about the necessity and lifesaving benefits of vaccination.

Health organizations are required to respond and correct the information to gain the public’s trust and influence it to follow the recommended instructions. Objectives:  (1) To examine ways for health organizations to correct misinformation concerning the measles vaccination on social networks for two groups: pro-vaccination and hesitant; (2) To examine the types of reactions of two subgroups (pro-vaccination, hesitant) to misinformation correction; and (3) To examine the effect of misinformation correction on these two subgroups regarding reliability, satisfaction, self-efficacy and intentions. Methods:  A controlled experiment with participants divided randomly into two conditions. In both experiment conditions a dilemma was presented as to sending a child to kindergarten, followed by an identical Facebook post voicing the children mothers’ concerns. In the third stage the correction by the health organization is presented differently in two conditions: Condition 1 –common information correction, and Condition 2 –recommended (theory-based) information correction, mainly communicating information transparently and addressing the public’s concerns. The study included (n = 243) graduate students from the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at Haifa University. Results:  A statistically significant difference was found in the reliability level attributed to information correction by the Health Ministry between the Control condition and Experimental condition (sig<0.001), with the average reliability level of the subjects in Condition 2 (M = 5.68) being considerably higher than the average reliability level of subjects in Condition 1 (4.64). A significant difference was found between Condition 1 and Condition 2 (sig<0.001), with the average satisfaction from the Health Ministry’s response of Condition 2 subjects (M = 5.75) being significantly higher than the average satisfaction level of Condition 1 subjects (4.66). Similarly, when we tested the pro and hesitant groups separately, we found that both preferred the response presented in Condition 2. Conclusion:  It is very important for the organizations to correct misinformation transparently, and to address the emotional aspects for both the pro-vaccination and the hesitant groups. The pro-vaccination group is not a captive audience, and it too requires a full response that addresses the public's fears and concerns.

The corporate malpractices motivating them are varied, including environmental pollution, lack of minimum labour standards, severe mistreatment of animals, lobbying and misinformation campaigns, collaboration or complicity with illegitimate political regimes, and systematic tax evasion and tax fraud. In this article, I argue that organised consumer boycotts should be regarded as a legitimate and purposeful instrument for structural change, provided they conform to a number of normative criteria. In order to show this, the practice and empirical context of consumer boycotts are first outlined. I then lay out and refute three general objections to this practice. Although each of these objections fails, their discussion generates insights concerning the normative standards with which boycotters must comply if they want their campaigns to be both legitimate and successful. These normative criteria are detailed along the lines of two guiding principles, proportionality and transparency. In the final step, I elaborate on structural change as the deeper purpose of consumer boycotts.

Exactly how they might leverage that trust remains unclear and untested. Building on recent work in correcting health misperceptions on social media, this study tests whether libraries can leverage trust to combat misinformation online. Using a misperception about the influenza vaccine as a test case, an experiment (n = 625) was conducted in fall 2018 using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Results suggest that the misperception can be reduced, but not by library institutions. An unsuccessful follow-up (n = 600) suggests that the effectiveness of the correction is season dependent and opens the possibility that libraries may yet play a role, but not necessarily because they are trusted. Future library proposals for combating misinformation need to be developed and tested within a broader contemporary misinformation research program. Highlights • Librarians are confident they have a role to play in fighting misinformation, but their solutions remain untested. • This study tests whether libraries can leverage trust online to reduce a misperception about the influenza vaccine. • Results suggest that the misperception can be reduced, but perhaps not by library institutions and not because of trust. • The study introduces a research tool (Amazon's MTurk) and initiates a new misinformation research program. • Future work needs to demonstrate the effectiveness of library solutions within that research program.

Methods: A YouTube™ search by using terms ""throat cancer"" and ""larynx cancer"" was done and, after eliminating the irrelevant videos, the first 200 videos were evaluated by three authors on quality, content and usefulness by using a pre-developed questionnaire. Videos were categorized according to the type and uploader separately to two (testimonial and educational) and five groups (health care, university, individual users, television channel/news and undetermined), respectively. Results: Videos that are uploaded by university-affiliated accounts have significantly better audiovisual quality score and have significantly higher accuracy and usefulness score results. Furthermore, the accuracy and usefulness scores of the educational group were found to be statistically higher than those of the testimonial group.

Counter-knowledge is defined as knowledge learned from unverified sources of information including hoaxes, rumour or partial lies. One of the contexts most prone to the presence of counter-knowledge is the health sector, when someone who is sick and suffers from a chronic illness, tends to seek for miraculous cures. This paper illustrates three cases in the recent history of Italy regarding the application of healthcare treatments. These cases show how the ""public authorities"" struggled to regain credibility due to the amplification and diffusion of elements of counter-knowledge. By using theories and concepts derived from the KM field, the cases are analysed to highlight the weakness of the ""official"" (and supposedly credible) sources of knowledge when they must face the upsurge of so many producers of unverifiable elements of knowledge, amplified by social media. Useful lessons for public institutions are finally derived. The findings also complement the KM studies by providing a clearer definition of counterknowledge and lessons to managers and decision makers, as to how they may overcome the presence of counter-knowledge.

Thus, automatic debunking of rumors is of great importance to keep social media a healthy environment. While facing a dubious claim, people often dispute its truthfulness sporadically in their posts containing various cues, which can form useful evidence with long-distance dependencies. In this work, we propose to learn discriminative features from microblog posts by following their non-sequential propagation structure and generate more powerful representations for identifying rumors. For modeling non-sequential structure, we first represent the diffusion of microblog posts with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how a claim in the original post is transmitted and developed over time. We then present a bottom-up and a top-down tree-structured models based on Recursive Neural Networks (RvNN) for rumor representation learning and classification, which naturally conform to the message propagation process in microblogs. To enhance the rumor representation learning, we reveal that effective rumor detection is highly related to finding evidential posts, e.g., the posts expressing specific attitude towards the veracity of a claim, as an extension of the previous RvNN-based detection models that treat every post equally. For this reason, we design discriminative attention mechanisms for the RvNN-based models to selectively attend on the subset of evidential posts during the bottom-up/top-down recursive composition. Experimental results on four datasets collected from real-world microblog platforms confirm that (1) our RvNN-based models achieve much better rumor detection and classification performance than state-of-the-art approaches; (2) the attention mechanisms for focusing on evidential posts can further improve the performance of our RvNN-based method; and (3) our approach possesses superior capacity on detecting rumors at a very early stage.

The way they responded to the challenge was different from case to case. Public libraries were the first to realize that they need to find solutions to stay in touch with their users, using the new media technologies, bringing to them credible and up-to- date information on topics of interest to each citizen or for each institution. Knowing the aspects of information literacy (especially digital literacy) have proved indispensable to be able to relate in this virtual form. In this paper we want to do a research on the mechanisms identified by each type of library to come in real support of users, given that fake news has invaded social media and it has become increasingly difficult for ordinary people to assess the correctness and the veracity of the information.

Insights into how to debunk this type of misinformation can especially be crucial for public health crises. To identify corrective information strategies that increase awareness and trigger actions during infectious disease outbreaks, an online experiment (N = 700) was conducted, using a U.S. sample. After initial misinformation exposure, participants' exposure to corrective information type (simple rebuttal vs. factual elaboration) and source (government health agency vs. news media vs. social peer) was varied, including a control group without corrective information. Results show that, if corrective information is present rather than absent, incorrect beliefs based on misinformation are debunked and the exposure to factual elaboration, compared to simple rebuttal, stimulates intentions to take protective actions. Moreover, government agency and news media sources are found to be more successful in improving belief accuracy compared to social peers. The observed mediating role of crisis emotions reveals the mechanism underlying the effects of corrective information. The findings contribute to misinformation research by providing a formula for correcting the increasing spread of misinformation in times of crisis.

We test strategies proposed in the recent literature for countering misinformation.

These falsehoods were published in professional journals, presented at conferences, and distributed through internet websites and blogs. This article summarizes five examples of published misinformation regarding PAS/PA. Each case study includes: the false statements that were published in the medical, psychological, or legal professional literature; the names of the individuals who made the false statements; and the steps taken to refute the falsehoods and correct the record. The writers of the misinformation were from Sweden, Tunisia, Spain, and the United States, which illustrates the international scope of PAS/PA. In one example, the misinformation reached the U.S. House of Representatives and was almost included in a formal resolution adopted by that body. The article discusses various underlying causes of the high level of polarization in PAS/PA scholarship. The article also proposes steps that both mental health and legal writers can adopt to reduce the destructive polarization that has occurred. In general, however, clinicians, forensic practitioners, and legal professionals should remain vigilant when they read articles or listen to presentations about topics that might be considered controversial. Key Points for the Family Court Community:Since 1985, a remarkable amount of misinformation regarding parental alienation and parental alienation syndrome has been published in professional literature and presented at conferences.When misinformation occurs in journal articles and books for mental health and legal professionals, readers may want to contact the editor and publisher in order to correct the record.When misinformation occurs in presentations at conferences for professionals, audience members may want to challenge the presenter to correct the false statements.When practitioners have conflicting opinions regarding a topic, a constructive activity might be for them to write an article together for publication, in which they clarify where they agree and where they disagree.

To study the anti-vaccine reaction linked to a change in French policy on vaccination, the main arguments used in videos with negative opinions on vaccination uploaded in 2017 and 2018 were also collected. We identified 166 videos: 120 (72.2%) were considered anti-vaccine videos and 46 (27.8%) were pro-vaccine; 92 (55%) were uploaded between 2017 and 2018. The anti-vaccine videos had been viewed 5,129,215 times and the pro-vaccine videos 2,371,048 times. The three most widely used anti-vaccination arguments were in regard to side effects (75.8%), pharmaceutical lobbying (61.3%), and the presence of adjuvants (51.6%). Health professionals should be aware of the widely disseminated vaccination misinformation available on the Internet. Health professionals and health authorities must invest in these platforms, perhaps in collaboration with popular channels, to inform users accurately and to refute arguments put forward by anti-vaccine videos.

A common countermeasure against cyber-epidemics is to disable a small subset of suspected social connections or accounts to effectively contain the epidemics. An example is the recent shutdown of 125,000 ISIS-related Twitter accounts. Despite many proposed methods to identify such a subset, none are scalable enough to provide high-quality solutions in nowadays’ billion-size networks. To this end, we investigate the Spread Interdiction problems that seek the most effective links (or nodes) for removal under the well-known Linear Threshold model. We propose novel CPU-GPU methods that scale to networks with billions of edges, yet possess rigorous theoretical guarantee on the solution quality. At the core of our methods is an $O(1)$ O (1) -space out-of-core algorithm to generate a new type of random walks, called Hitting Self-avoiding Walks ($\mathsf{HSAW}$ HSAW s). Such a low memory requirement enables handling of big networks and, more importantly, hiding latency via scheduling of millions of threads on GPUs. Comprehensive experiments on real-world networks show that our algorithms provide much higher quality solutions and are several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the art. Comparing to the (single-core) CPU counterpart, our GPU implementations achieve significant speedup factors up to 177x on a single GPU and 338x on a GPU pair.

Alas, attempts to debunk misinformation have proven sub-optimal, and have even been shown to “backfire”, including increasing misperceptions. Thus, optimized debunking strategies have been developed to more effectively combat misinformation. The aim of this study was to test these strategies in a real-world setting, targeting misinformation about autism interventions. In the context of professional development training, we randomly assigned participants to an “optimized-debunking” or a “treatment-as-usual” training condition and compared support for non-empirically-supported treatments before, after, and six weeks following completion of online training. Results demonstrated greater benefits of optimized debunking immediately after training; thus, the implemented strategies can serve as a general and flexible debunking template. However, the effect was not sustained at follow-up, highlighting the need for further research into strategies for sustained change.

Research is needed to explore risk perceptions of developing smoking-related disease among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Data came from 267 HIV-positive smokers who completed an online survey assessing perceived health risks associated with (a) generic smoking status; (b) generic non-smoking status; (c) their own personal current smoking; and (d) a hypothetical situation in which they were a non-smoker. PLWH perceived greater risk associated with their current smoking versus hypothetical personal non-smoking (p’s < 0.001), and greater risks associated with generic smoking status compared with their current smoking (p’s < 0.001). Being on HIV medication (β = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.17, 1.12), interest in quitting smoking (β = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.45, 1.32), and having an HIV healthcare provider who has recommended cessation (β = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.42, 1.67) were positively associated with perceived risk of developing smoking-related diseases. Findings have implications for developing targeted interventions to correct misperceptions regarding the health risks of smoking among PLWH, a population at particular risk for smoking and smoking-related morbidity and mortality.

Qualitative content analysis. All pages that inform and educate parents regarding childhood vaccination were downloaded and analyzed according to evidence-informed risk communication metrics. A total of 32 webpages, 14 videos, and two infographics were included in the analysis. The following were the most frequent risk communication approaches: 'debunking common misconceptions about vaccination' or 'answering common questions about vaccines.' Harm and benefit information focused primarily on the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases and the risks of adverse events after immunization. Most materials used qualitative terminology to describe the risk (e.g., vaccines are among the safest tools, adverse events are rare). Very few materials provided numeric likelihood of harms and benefits. When numeric information was stated, they were only presenting the risks of the diseases or number of cases in an outbreak. The approaches used to debunk misconceptions generally focused on the myth itself rather than the correct information. Few materials used visual aids (e.g., graphics, pictures, icons arrays, etc.) to convey important information. It is often assumed that misinformation and rumors about vaccination found online is a leading cause of the increase in vaccine hesitancy. Existing communication materials could be improved to better align with best practices in risk communication. Given the availability of confusing and conflicting vaccine narratives, it is crucial that authoritative communication materials aim to build trust and support informed choices about vaccination. • Internet is increasingly used for health information, including vaccination. • Online vaccine misinformation is often blamed for the increase in vaccine hesitancy. • Vaccine-hesitant parents are looking for 'balanced' information on vaccines. • Public health websites may not address the needs of vaccine-hesitant parents.

To investigate this possibility, an experiment was conducted exposing users to a simulated Facebook News Feed featuring misinformation and different correction mechanisms (one in which news stories featuring correct information were produced by an algorithm and another where the corrective news stories were posted by other Facebook users) about the Zika virus, a current global health threat. Results show that algorithmic and social corrections are equally effective in limiting misperceptions, and correction occurs for both high and low conspiracy belief individuals. Recommendations for social media campaigns to correct global health misinformation, including encouraging users to refute false or misleading health information, and providing them appropriate sources to accompany their refutation, are discussed.

In this paper, we propose an integrated methodology for the data collection, the reconstruction, the analysis and the visualization of the development of a country’s political landscape from Twitter data. Method:  The proposed method relies solely on the interactions between Twitter accounts and is independent of the characteristics of the shared contents such as the language of the tweets. We validate our methodology on a case study on the 2017 French presidential election (60 million Twitter exchanges between more than 2.4 million users) via two independent methods: the comparison between our automated political categorization and a human categorization based on the evaluation of a sample of 5000 profiles descriptions; the correspondence between the reconfigurations detected in the reconstructed political landscape and key political events reported in the media. This latter validation demonstrated the ability of our approach to accurately reflect the reconfigurations at play in the off-line political scene. Results:  We built on this reconstruction to give insights into the opinion dynamics and the reconfigurations of political communities at play during a presidential election. First, we propose a quantitative description and analysis of the political engagement of members of political communities. Second, we analyze the impact of political communities on information diffusion and in particular on their role in the fake news phenomena. We measure a differential echo chamber effect on the different types of political news (fake news, debunks, standard news) caused by the community structure and emphasize the importance of addressing the meso-structures of political networks in understanding the fake news phenomena. Conclusions:  Giving access to an intermediate level, between sociological surveys in the field and large statistical studies (such as those conducted by national or international organizations) we demonstrate that social networks data make it possible to qualify and quantify the activity of political communities in a multi-polar political environment; as well as their temporal evolution and reconfiguration, their structure, their alliance strategies and their semantic particularities during a presidential campaign through the analysis of their digital traces. We conclude this paper with a comment on the political and ethical implications of the use of social networks data in politics. We stress the importance of developing social macroscopes that will enable citizens to better understand how they collectively make society and propose as example the “Politoscope”, a macroscope that delivers some of our results in an interactive way.

Our findings indicate that, irrespective of the source, multimodal disinformation is considered slightly more credible than textual disinformation. Fact checkers can help to overcome the potential harmful consequences of disinformation. We also found that fact checkers can overcome partisan and attitudinal filters – which points to the relevance of fact checking as a journalistic discipline.

Methods: To determine which online forums to use, Google was searched using five common childhood ailments. Forums that appeared five or more times in the first five pages of the Google search for each question were considered. Of these forums, those that met the inclusion criteria were used. Data from a sixmonth time period was collected and categorized from the discussion forums to analyze the advice being provided about common childhood ailments. Evidence-based resources were used to analyze the accuracy of the advice provided. Results: Two discussion forums were chosen for analysis. Seventy-four questions from one and 131 questions from the other were health related. Data were not analyzed together. Of the health-related questions on the 2 forums, 65.5% and 51.8%, respectively, provided some type of advice. Of the advice provided, 54.1% and 47.2%, respectively, agreed with the evidence provided in evidence-based resources. A further 16.2% and 6.3% was refuted or was somewhat refuted by the evidence found in evidence-based resources. Conclusion: While roughly half of the health-related advice provided in online discussion forums aimed at parents of young children is accurate, only a small portion of the advice is incorrect; therefore, these sources are not a major concern for the spread of misinformation.

When used correctly, social media is an effective tool to communicate and to share food safety news and good practices. However, there have been reports of fake food safety news shared via social media, fueling panic and resulting in a loss of revenue. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the consumers' awareness, trust, and usage of social media in communicating food safety news in Malaysia. A questionnaire divided into five sections--(i) demographics, (ii) reaction to food safety news, (iii) consumers' awareness, (iv) social media truth and level of trust, and (v) social media uses and content creation--was created and shared online. A total of 341 questionnaires were returned of which 339 surveys were valid. This study revealed that less than one-third of the study group (27.1%) knew which of the food safety news were fake. Most respondents (67.8%) were less likely to purchase the affected foods if the foods were featured in social media as problematic, although no differences were made between true and fake news and how that would influence respondents' willingness to purchase affected foods. Overall, 62% of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed about the usage of social media and its ability to prevent food poisoning cases, while more than 50% of the respondents were in total agreement that social media allow consumers to act more responsibly by sharing food safety news. Respondents tended to trust information shared by scientists (67.5%) and family members and friends (33%). Respondents would most often share the news after verifying its authenticity (46%). If respondents experienced a personal food safety issue (e.g., discovered a fly in their meal), they seldom or never took photos to post online (56.1%). It is possible that the respondents preferred to inform the food handlers and/or shop owners about the affected products rather than post the photos online. It is suggested that targeted food safety information and media literacy be provided to improve consumers' awareness and to positively influence self-verification of the food safety information before sharing. This study provides crucial insights for a range of stakeholders, particularly public authorities, food bloggers, and the public, in using social media effectively to build consumers' awareness and trust in food safety information.

We recently showed that most health professionals misinterpret the frequencies of listed side effects as solely caused by the drug. The present study investigated whether (1) these misinterpretations also prevail among laypeople and (2) alternative PLs reduce these misinterpretations. Methods:  In March 2017, 397 out of 400 laypeople approached completed an online survey. They were randomized to one of four PL formats: three alternative PLs (drug facts box with/without reading instruction, narrative format with numbers) and one standard PL. Each PL listed four side effects for a fictitious drug: two were presented as occurring more often, one as equally often, and one as less often with drug intake. The alternative formats (interventions) included information on frequencies with and without drug intake and included a statement on the causal relation. The standard PL (control) only included information on frequency ranges with drug intake. Questions were asked on general occurrence and causality of side effects. Results:  Participants randomized to the standard PL were unable to answer questions on causality. For side effects occurring more often (equally; less often) with drug intake, only 1.9% to 2.8% (equally: 1.9%; less often: 1.9%) provided correct responses about the causal nature of side effects, compared to 55.0% to 81.9% (equally: 23.8% to 70.5%; less often: 21.0% to 43.2%) of participants who received alternative PLs. It remains unclear whether one alternative format is superior to the others. Conclusion:  In conclusion, information on the frequency of side effects in current package leaflets is misleading. Comparative presentation of frequencies for side effects with and without drug intake including statements on the causal relation significantly improves understanding.

We argue that this understanding of NPS is fundamentally problematic. Differences within the category are obscured, as are similarities between NPS and more established categories of drugs. Focusing on NPS as something new, different or particularly special is misleading and counterproductive and can have serious consequences in terms of understanding the bigger picture in relation to illegal drugs more generally. This has led to overestimations of the size of the NPS problem, obfuscation of the common underlying causes of dependent drug use and the implementation of significant and problematic policy changes. Furthermore, a failure to see the rise in NPS as just one of a number of emerging trends in contemporary drug scenes, alongside the development of online markets or the rise in domestic drug production operations, for example, impairs our ability to understand the wider societal, cultural and theoretical underpinnings of drug use. NPS are not particularly special: treating them as such can have dangerous and far-reaching consequences.

It consists of three current transformers (CTs) and three potential transformers (PTs). Cost of IEMS increases with improvement in its accuracy class. The contribution of this article is that, it adduces design and development of high accuracy class and cost-effective IEMS. To accomplish this, a novel Industrial Energy Measurement-Error Compensation Unit (IEM-ECU) is proposed. To realize this, first, the three different accuracy classes, viz. 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 IEMS are fabricated in the laboratory. Characteristics of every CT and PT are determined. Second, the proposed error correction algorithm is implemented in real time to improve errors of IEMS. Finally, the experimental results are depicted in LabVIEW for mixed class of CTs and PTs. Various experimental tests have been performed and results are validated by comparing the results obtained from digital storage oscilloscope. These results clearly illustrate that the proposed IEM-ECU not only convert lower accuracy class IEMS to higher accuracy class but it also gives flexibility to use available class of CTs and/or PTs, if required under contingency. Thereby, considerable cost savings can be achieved as the performance of lower accuracy class matches with the higher accuracy class.

Smoke emissions and exposure monitoring is critical for public and environmental health protection; however, groundlevel measurements of smoke from wildfires and prescribed fires has proven difficult, as existing (validated) monitoring technologies are expensive, cumbersome, and generally require line power. Few ground-based measurements are made during fire events, which limits our ability to assess the environmental and human health impacts of wildland fire smoke. The objective of this work was to develop and validate an Outdoor Aerosol Sampler (OAS) - a filter-based air sampler that has been miniaturized, solar powered, and weatherproofed. This sampler was designed to overcome several of the technical challenges of wildland fire monitoring by being relatively inexpensive and solar powered. The sampler design objectives were achieved by leveraging low-cost electronic components, open-source programming platforms, and inhouse fabrication methods. A direct-reading PM2:5 sensor was selected and integrated with the OAS to provide timeresolved concentration data. Cellular communications established via short message service (SMS) technology were utilized in transmitting online sensor readings and controlling the sampling device remotely. A Monte Carlo simulation aided in the selection of battery and solar power necessary to independently power the OAS, while keeping cost and size to a minimum. Thirteen OAS were deployed to monitor smoke concentrations downwind from a large prescribed fire. Aerosol mass concentrations were interpolated across the monitoring network to depict smoke concentration gradients in the vicinity of the fire. Strong concentration gradients were observed spatially and temporally) and likely present due to a combination of changing fire location and intensity, topographical features (e.g., mountain ridges), and diurnal weather patterns. Gravimetric filter measurements made by the OAS (when corrected for filter collection efficiency) showed relatively good agreement with measurements from an EPA federal equivalent monitor. However, the real-time optical sensor (Sharp GP2Y1023AU0F, Sharp Electronic Co.) within the OAS suffered from temperature dependence, drift, and imprecision.

However, downloading and analyzing raw or semi-processed microarray data from GEO is not intuitive and requires manual error-prone analysis and a bioinformatics background. This is due to a lack of standardization in array platform fabrication as well as the lack of a simple interactive tool for clustering, plotting, differential expression testing, and testing for functional enrichment. Results: We introduce the Bioinformatics Array Research Tool (BART), an R Shiny web application that automates the microarray download and analysis process across diverse microarray platforms. It provides an intuitive interface, automatically downloads and parses data from GEO, suggests groupings of samples for differential expression testing, performs batch effect correction, outputs quality control plots, converts probe IDs, generates full lists of differentially expressed genes, and performs functional enrichment analysis. We show that BART enables a more comprehensive analysis of a wider range of microarray datasets on GEO by comparing it to four leading online microarray analysis tools. Conclusions: BART allows a scientist with no bioinformatics background to extract knowledge from their own microarray data or microarray experiments available from GEO. BART is functional on more microarray experiments and provides more comprehensive analyses than extant microarray analysis tools.

However, there is a growing misperception that congeries of data can be easily reconstructed into competitive business insights. Such notions have been encouraged by a plethora of mainstream techno-utopian forecasts. Design/methodology/approach: This paper investigated such claims and related big data developments, including its ""systems-first"" and oligopolistic orientations. Due to the paucity of current scholarship on an admittedly pessimistic topic, the paper studied contrarian developments in the industry by relying on secondary data. The study of experts and scholars; industrial trends; and discrepancies and critical gaps in the mainstream data narrative were sourced to prognosticate the likely trajectory of many data giants. Findings: A key finding was that the big data industry faces an untenable market bubble worth trillions of dollars. This will have severe consequences for common digital access and social stability worldwide. Evidence presented also suggests that the data industrial complex may undergo a function creep by facilitating a transition from surveillance capitalism to surveillance society. Research limitations/implications: Primary data for a study of this nature may take years to materialize. This is a ""first-pass"" study that seeks to illuminate latent dangers facing the big data/AI sector. There is a paucity of scholarly study that even remotely touches on this topic. Therefore, supporting arguments was sourced from contemporary reports and expert study (secondary data). Practical implications: As control of data may have geostrategic implications, balkanization of the wired ecosystem may be underway with Russia and China leading the way. Future superpowers may be defined by the way they handle data. The concentration of data in fewer hands may also affect citizen innovation. Social implications: A break-down of the data industrial complex may lead to social mayhem as the monetization of presently free software, blogs and social media platforms may be unfeasible. Originality/value: This topic has hardly been explored due to the novelty of big data, its applications and the daily hype over its potentials. This paper boldly describes dark countercurrents in the industry.

In this work, we examine the effectiveness of debunking on Facebook through a quantitative analysis of 54 million users over a time span of five years (Jan 2010, Dec 2014). In particular, we compare how users usually consuming proven (scientific) and unsubstantiated (conspiracy-like) information on Facebook US interact with specific debunking posts. Our findings confirm the existence of echo chambers where users interact primarily with either conspiracy-like or scientific pages. However, both groups interact similarly with the information within their echo chamber. Then, we measure how users from both echo chambers interacted with 50,220 debunking posts accounting for both users consumption patterns and the sentiment expressed in their comments. Sentiment analysis reveals a dominant negativity in the comments to debunking posts. Furthermore, such posts remain mainly confined to the scientific echo chamber. Only few conspiracy users engage with corrections and their liking and commenting rates on conspiracy posts increases after the interaction.

With the propagation of the internet, public health officials must now compete with other official and unofficial sources of information to get their message out. Aims: This study aimed at critically appraising videos available on one popular internet video site (YouTube) as a source of information for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Materials and Methods: Videos were searched in YouTube (http://www.youtube.com) using the keyword ""Ebola outbreak"" from inception to November 1, 2014 with the default ""relevance"" filter. Only videos in English language under 10 min duration within first 10 pages of search were included. Duplicates were removed and the rest were classified as useful or misleading by two independent reviewers. Video sources were categorized by source. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient. Continuous and categorical variables were analyzed using the Student t-test and Chi-squared test, respectively. Results: One hundred and eighteen out of 198 videos were evaluated. Thirty-one (26.27%) videos were classified as misleading and 87 (73.73%) videos were classified as useful. The kappa coefficient of agreement regarding the usefulness of the videos was 0.68 (P < 0.001). Independent users were more likely to post misleading videos (93.55% vs 29.89%, OR = 34.02, 95% CI = 7.55-153.12, P < 0.001) whereas news agencies were most likely to post useful videos (65.52% vs 3.23%, OR = 57.00, 95% CI = 7.40-438.74, P < 0.001).

Scientific debates over global catastrophic flooding and the Earth's geologic age were resolved by the mid-nineteenth century, but subsequent nonscientific debates about the Earth's age and biological evolution spawned a distrust of science that hardened in the twentieth century. Disregard for science grew in the United States with abandonment of science-based policy by government and manipulation of public opinion by social media. Consequently, climate change denial was readily accepted by a preconditioned antiscience culture. Expansion of antiscience sentiment led to rejection of conventional news outlets and information verification in a ""post-truth"" era in which alternate realities are acceptable despite clear contradictions with observable facts. Critical reasoning and vetting of information are in decline, which leaves democracy vulnerable to manipulation. Reliable information is available but obscured by disinformation. Public scrutiny of information and demand for fact checking and reporting of sources are essential given growth of alternative media that have no checks on the verity of content. Academics should get involved in popular media to counter propaganda and to reconstruct a culture of critical reasoning by voters and science-based decisions by policymakers.

This paper analyzes the distribution of alternative facts and fake news as a phenomenon characterizing post-fact society and how journalistic work processes may promote and legitimize the distribution of misleading content. The study looks into the back- and front-stage performances of journalistic information processing that are influenced by social time acceleration and the insistence of 'click-bait' news criteria. We used three different methods for teaching news reporting on three different groups of Estonian journalism students, and analyzed their performance using self-reflection in focus group interviews. Two groups of students, whose assignments were geared toward the outcome, focused more on front stage performances and underestimated back stage performances, e.g. the evaluation of sources, background information gathering, and fact checking. One group, which was taught news reporting as a process of information filtering, perceived and reflected both front and back stage performances. The results indicate that (online) newsroom practice, which is influenced by time pressure and the continuous requirement of new content, may force journalists to skip the stages of conventional journalistic information processing and due to that create favorable environment for publishing and distributing misleading and fake news.

Here we argue that in the current political and media environment faulty communication is no longer the core of the problem. Distrust in the scientific enterprise and misperceptions of scientific knowledge increasingly stem less from problems of communication and more from the widespread dissemination of misleading and biased information. We describe the profound structural shifts in the media environment that have occurred in recent decades and their connection to public policy decisions and technological changes. We explain how these shifts have enabled unscrupulous actors with ulterior motives increasingly to circulate fake news, misinformation, and disinformation with the help of trolls, bots, and respondent-driven algorithms. We document the high degree of partisan animosity, implicit ideological bias, political polarization, and politically motivated reasoning that now prevail in the public sphere and offer an actual example of how clearly stated scientific conclusions can be systematically perverted in the media through an internet-based campaign of disinformation and misinformation. We suggest that, in addition to attending to the clarity of their communications, scientists must also develop online strategies to counteract campaigns of misinformation and disinformation that will inevitably follow the release of findings threatening to partisans on either end of the political spectrum.

There are significant public doubts in expediency of investments in renewables in place. Our paper studies the factors related to the public opinion on renewables using a reasonable and representative sample of respondents (N = 1026) from one of the EU Member States, the Czech Republic, via a set of ordinal regression analyses with spline correction for ordinal predictors. Our results suggest that the population of the Czech Republic is split in half in its trust in renewables as a substitute to traditional energy sources. In addition, our results show that the opinions on renewables in the Czech Republic are significantly related to personal concerns on environmental protection and worries about use of nuclear energy. Moreover, we find that traditional mass media is not statistically significant, even though internet news channels and social media were statistically related to the opinions (negatively and positively, respectively). The comparison of the responses with respect to the frequency of following social media support the hypothesis of the media bubble. The empirical results indicate that public opinions on renewables are likely to be built on the information sources vulnerable to hoaxes, bubbles, and misinformation. We conclude that more media presentation on RES is needed and make some practical suggestions for the stakeholders, journalists, and relevant policymakers.

This kind of communicationand dissemination of terrorist and criminal ideas is not only muchcheaper, because it requires only an investment in a computer andaccess to the network, but it is anonymous, it is not spatiallylimited, terroristic idea and terroristic actions are performed at the same time, while the consequences can affect even more people and targets than is the case of ""offline"" criminality and terrorism. In recent years, the increasing problem that experts talk of in public is the ""dark side of surfing the internet"", the ""Dark net"" or the “Deep Web"". Cyber terrorism is a modern form of terrorism, which connects the virtual space and terrorist activity, by manipulating even more efficient methods of psychological warfare. In the cyberspace you never know who could be the next victim. Based on the characteristics of cyber terrorism and cyber warfare, it is possible to reconstruct the criminological dimensions of the terrorist attacks in cyberspace. Social networks can be used by terrorists for the purpose of psychological warfare in order to spread disinformation, fear, panic, intimidating messages and threats to the public. Since there is not a unique definition of cyber terrorism, this paper presents various definitions, implying numerous characteristics of this kind of criminal activity. The paper also pointed out to some of the international legislation that made great efforts in order to effectively counter fight cyber terrorism, both on international as well as at member state level, and emphasized the need for interstate and intergovernmental cooperation on three parallel levels: through international organizations, through multilateral and multinational platforms and through regional action.

Of 974 participants, 29% indicated that they worried about EVD, 4% correctly stated virus transmission routes, and 75% incorrectly rated airborne transmission and transmission by asymptomatic patients as possible.

With approximately six million (11%) of the UK population now listening to podcasts in an average week, the podcast renaissance raises new questions about the relationship between cultural production, consumption and representation. This paper explores the significance of the new wave of podcasts, specifically with regards to racial politics in the UK and its potential power as an anti-racist tool. Through a series of interview and focus group discussions with black and Asian podcasters in the UK, it asks what role podcasts play in providing an alternative space for 'communities of resistance'. These issues are examined against the dual contexts in the UK of an intensifyingly hostile environment for black and minority ethnic groups and a digital and creative sector marked by social and cultural inequalities. The article suggests that in a 'post fact' international climate of disinformation that bolsters populist rhetoric around minority cultural groups, podcasts have become a rare space for articulating the lived experiences of these groups, whilst also challenging broader patterns of racialized disenfranchisement, including in the creative industries. Podcasts facilitate new forms of social affiliation and anti-racism; which we analyse through Fraser's concept of ""subaltern counterpublics"" to unveil the interruptive potentiality of the medium for marginalised communities seeking to make accessible alternative representations and perspectives on the relationship between race and society.

In addition to inherent touch detection, physiological and environmental sensor interfaces are incorporated. The reconfigurable feature is effectively implemented by proposing two basis readout topologies of amplifier-based and oscillator-based circuits. For noise-immune design against various noises from inherent human-touch operations, an alternate-sampling error-correction scheme is proposed and integrated inside the ROIC, achieving a 12-bit resolution of successive approximation register (SAR) of analog-to-digital conversion without additional calibrations. A ROIC prototype that includes the whole proposed functions and data converters was fabricated in a 0.18 µm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, and its feasibility was experimentally verified to support multiple heterogeneous sensing functions of touch, electrocardiogram, body impedance, and environmental sensors.

We document the history of StopFake, describe its work practices, and situate them within the literatures on fact checking and online news practices. Our study of its work practices shows that StopFake employs the online media monitoring characteristic of modern journalism, but rather than imitating new stories it applies media literacy techniques to screen out fake news and inhibit its spread. StopFake evaluates news stories for signs of falsified evidence, such as manipulated or misrepresented images and quotes, whereas traditional fact-checking sites evaluate nuanced political claims but assume the accuracy of reporting. Drawing on work from science studies, we argue that attention of this kind to social processes demonstrates that scholars can acknowledge that narratives are socially constructed without having to treat all narratives as interchangeable.

The government has appealed to China to fund large-scale projects in the transport sector, and as a consequence of this, construction firms from China have emerged as significant employers in the country. While the Kenyan government contends with the ongoing burden of youth unemployment, it must also reconcile the ambiguities of China's role in Africa and its implications for the labour market. This article examines two Chinese-built infrastructure projects in Kenya and their intersection with several issues involving migrant labour and local rumours of Chinese prisoners, as well as the state's vision for industrialization and youth employment. Kenyans utilize both online and interpersonal channels of discourse to critique present-day employment practices in the transport sector, and it is argued that these counter-channels of discourse represent a particular articulation of knowledge used by Kenyans to construct meaning and interpret ambiguous situations. Through a theoretical analysis of rumour, this article illustrates how ordinary Kenyans are pooling their intellectual resources to understand Sino-Kenyan labour relations in the absence of transparency and participatory government processes in the infrastructure sector.

Methods:  Four national and 82 local (British Columbia) Canadian online news sites were searched for articles posted between August 2012 and May 2013 containing the words “healthcare workers” and “mandatory influenza vaccinations/immunizations” or “mandatory flu shots and healthcare workers.” We included articles from sources that predominantly concerned our topic of interest and that generated reader comments. Two researchers coded the unedited comments using thematic analysis, categorizing codes to allow themes to emerge. In addition to themes, the comments were categorized by: 1) sentiment towards influenza vaccines; 2) support for mandatory vaccination policies; 3) citing of reference materials or statistics; 4) self-identified health-care worker status; and 5) sharing of a personal story. Results:  1163 comments made by 648 commenters responding to 36 articles were analyzed. Popular themes included concerns about freedom of choice, vaccine effectiveness, patient safety, and distrust in government, public health, and the pharmaceutical industry. Almost half (48%) of commenters expressed a negative sentiment toward the influenza vaccine, 28% were positive, 20% were neutral, and 4% expressed mixed sentiment. Of those who commented on the policy, 75% did not support the condition to work policy, while 25% were in favour. Of the commenters, 11% self-identified as healthcare workers, 13% shared personal stories, and 18% cited a reference or statistic. Interpretation:  The perception of the influenza vaccine in the comment sections of online news sites is fairly poor. Public health agencies should consider including online forums, comment sections, and social media sites as part of their communication channels to correct misinformation regarding the benefits of HCW influenza immunization and the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Rumor as unverified information also considerably spreads in social networks. The study of how rumor spreads and how it can be controlled, plays an important role in reducing social and psychological damages of rumor in social networks. Although recent researches have mainly focused on epidemic models and structure of social networks, they ignore the impact of people's decision on rumor process. In this paper, an evolutionary game model is proposed to analyze the rumor process in social network considering the impacts of people's decisions on rumor propagation and control. The model considers a rumor control mechanism via sending anti-rumor messages through rumor control centers. Factors affecting the people's decisions including social anxiety, people's attitude toward rumor/anti-rumor, strength of rumor/anti-rumor, influence of rumor control centers, and participation of people in discussions are studied in the model. The proposed game model is analyzed by replicator dynamics equations and simulation of the imitation update rule on a synthetic (Barabasi–Albert) and two real-world graphs of Twitter and Facebook. We further analyze the model in various environments considering people characteristics and society situation. Also we use a real rumor dataset of Twitter (Pheme dataset) to first compare the trends of people strategies (rumor/anti-rumor spreader and ignorant) derived by the model with the real trends of the traits of people in the rumor spreading on Twitter. Then we conduct a number of sensitivity analysis experiments to show the impact of different factors on rumor process. In fact, we analyze the trends of people strategies in Pheme dataset assuming various possible conditions. The analysis show that propagation of convincing anti-rumor messages and locating rumor control centers impact debunking the rumor. Moreover, it is shown that people attitude toward rumor/anti-rumor has significant impact on rumor spreading. Besides, factors such as social anxiety and strength of rumor accelerates rumor propagation. • A new evolutionary game model on graph for rumor propagation by considering the people characteristics and the society situations. • Anxiety of the society, people attitude toward rumor, and strength of rumor reinforce the rumor propagation. • People attitude toward anti-rumor, strength of anti-rumor, and querying the rumor control center can control rumor propagation.

As various forms of treatment and other interventions are becoming available over the Internet, the bulk of e-health remains related to information about health and illness (1-5). While the positive aspects of health information on the Internet have been highlighted, less has been published about related challenges. Methods: We performed a narrative review of the literature on challenges connected to health information on the Internet. A literature search containing various search terms relating to challenges with health information retrieval from the Internet was performed on PubMed and Web of Science and supplemented with hand searches. Results: A range of challenges were found to be associated with online health information, including a lack of searching skills, not being able to identify misinformation or commercialized or biased information, information overload, not properly understanding correct information, and not being able to make use of the information in terms of taking some action. Discussion and conclusion: Health information on the Internet can enable people to make better choices, for instance regarding life-style and treatment. However, several challenges need to be addressed in order to improve the use of the Internet as a channel for health information. Stakeholders who use the Internet for the dissemination of health-related information should be aware of these factors when planning and implementing their strategies. Lessons learnt, limitations and suggestions for future research: A main lesson learnt was that while health information on the Internet is positive overall, there are some challenges related to obtaining, understanding and making use of this type of information. This was a narrative review and the method has several important limitations, including that the literature search was not systematic. There is a need to focus also on the challenges related to the use of e-Health and more research is needed in order to know more about how to overcome these challenges.

Fundamental to suicide prevention efforts is public awareness, which in turn, is influenced by literacy levels about men's depression and suicide. Aim: The aim of this study is to examine sex differences in mental health literacy with respect to men's depression and suicide among a cohort of Canadian respondents. Methods: About 901 English-speaking Canadian men and women completed online survey questionnaires to evaluate mental health literacy levels using 10-item D-Lit and 8-item LOSS questionnaires, which assess factual knowledge concerning men's depression and suicide. Statistical tests (Chi-square, z-test) were used to identify significant differences between sex sub-groups at 95% confidence. Results: Overall, respondents correctly identified 67% of questions measuring literacy levels about male depression. Respondents' male suicide literacy was significantly poorer at 53.7%. Misperceptions were especially evident in terms of differentiating men's depressive symptoms from other mental illnesses, estimating prevalence and identifying factors linked to male suicide. Significant sex differences highlighted that females had higher literacy levels than men in regard to male depression. Conclusions: Implementing gender sensitive and specific programs to target and advance literacy levels about men's depression may be key to ultimately reducing depression and suicide among men in Canada.

Here, we provide an overview of how and why citizens become (and sometimes remain) misinformed about science. Our discussion focuses specifically on misinformation among individual citizens. However, it is impossible to understand individual information processing and acceptance without taking into account social networks, information ecologies, and other macro-level variables that provide important social context. Specifically, we show how being misinformed is a function of a person's ability and motivation to spot falsehoods, but also of other group-level and societal factors that increase the chances of citizens to be exposed to correct(ive) information. We conclude by discussing a number of research areas--some of which echo themes of the 2017 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Communicating Science Effectively report--that will be particularly important for our future understanding of misinformation, specifically a systems approach to the problem of misinformation, the need for more systematic analyses of science communication in new media environments, and a (re)focusing on traditionally underserved audiences.

These accounts offered a resistance-focused narrative about the administration. In this paper, we ask who the people are that ran these accounts, what their goals or purposes were during this time, and how they used Twitter to achieve their goals. To answer these questions, we conducted twelve interviews with some of the individuals behind the accounts and descriptively analyzed 43,569 tweets generated by these 102 accounts during the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. We discovered that not all accounts were not actually being run by agency employees, and that the account administrators had goals of creating a network of ""resistance"" by sharing scientific information, correcting misinformation, and contributing to the news cycle. They relied on the referentiality that Twitter affords through its features to expand beyond 140 characters to do this. • Analyzed 43 k tweets from 100+ ""rogue"" government agency Twitter accounts. • Conducted 12 interviews with ""rogue"" Twitter account authors. • Authors sought solidarity, to promote ""resistance"" to Trump agenda, contribute to news. • Twitter's affordances were essential to realizing the accounts' goals. • Referentiality was especially critical for maintaining resistance networks.

Also, there is strong evidence that fixation of C2 anatomical pedicle has the best biomechanical profile of the entire cervical spine. However, it is often difficult and misleading, to evaluate anatomical bony and vascular anomalies using the three orthogonal planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) of CT. Objectives: The authors describe an innovative and simple technique to evaluate the feasibility of C2 pedicle for surgical screw fixation using preoperative planning with the free DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) software OsiriXTM. Materials and Methods: The authors report the applicatin of this novel technique in 5 cases (3 traumatic, 1Os Odontoideum, and 1 complex congenital malformation) collected from our general case series of the Department in the last 5 years. Results: In this ""proof of concept"" study, the pre-operative analysis with the ""two-step"" tecnique was detrimental for choosing the surgical tecnique. Detailed post-operative analysis confirmed correct position of C2 screws without cortical breach. There were no complications or mortality reported. Conclusion: This ""two-step"" technique is an easy and reliable way to determine the feasibility of C2 pedicle for surgical fixation. The detailed tridimensional radiological preoperative evaluation of craniovertebral junction anatomy is critical to the sucess and safety of this surgeries, and can avoid, to certain degree, expensive intra-operative tridimensional imaging facilities.

With these new technologies comes an essential need for testing methods to assess the resultant image quality. Although randomized clinical trials are the gold standard for assessing image quality, phantom‐based studies can provide a simpler and less burdensome approach. In this work, a complete framework is presented for task‐based evaluation of microcalcification (MCs) detection performance for DBT imaging systems. Methods: The framework consists of three parts. The first part is a realistic anthropomorphic physical breast phantom created through inkjet printing, with parchment paper and iodine‐doped ink. The second is a method for inserting realistic MCs fabricated from calcium hydroxyapatite. The reproducibility and stability of the phantom materials were investigated through multiple samples of parchment and ink over 6 months. The final part is an analysis using a four‐alternative forced choice (4AFC) reader study. To demonstrate the framework, a task‐based 4AFC study was conducted using a clinical system to compare performance from DBT, synthetic mammography (SM), and full‐field digital mammography (FFDM). Nine human observers read images containing MC clusters imaged with all three modalities and tried to correctly locate the MCs. The proportion correct (PC) was measured as the number of correctly detected clusters out of all trials. Results: Overall, readers scored the highest with FFDM, (PC = 0.95 ± 0.03) then DBT (0.85 ± 0.04), and finally SM (0.44 ± 0.06). For the parchment and ink samples, the linear attenuation properties were very stable over 6 months. In addition, little difference was found between the various parchment and ink samples, indicating good reproducibility. Conclusions: This framework presents a promising methodology for evaluating diagnostic task performance of clinical breast DBT systems.

Previous works often dealt with either individuals' trust in rumors or their willingness to share. Juxtaposing both in the same study, the aim of this paper is to investigate medical professionals' intentions to trust and share online health rumors as a function of their personal involvement, the rumor type, and the presence of counter-rumors. Personal involvement refers to individuals’ perceived relevance of a rumor. Two common types of rumors include dread and wish. Counter-rumors are messages that debunk rumors. A within-participants experiment was conducted with 60 participants, divided evenly among doctors, nurses and medical students, each of whom was exposed to eight cancer-related rumors. Rumor type and the presence of counter-rumors were induced. Personal involvement, intention to trust, and intention to share were measured using a questionnaire. Results showed that personal involvement compelled intentions to trust and share. Dread rumors triggered intentions to trust and share more than did wish rumors. The presence of counter-rumors lowered intention to trust, but not intention to share. Moreover, rumor type moderated the relation between personal involvement and intentions to trust and share.

However, the properties of the three types of messages are relatively unknown particularly in the social media context. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to examine these three types of messages posted on social media in the wake of a rumor outbreak.Design/methodology/approach Data included tweets posted after the outbreak of a rumor that wrongly accused the fast food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) for selling rats instead of chicken. Using a deductive approach, codes were derived via content analysis on the tweets. Volume and exposure of tweets were also examined.Findings Counter-rumor tweets (52 percent) outnumbered rumors tweets (32 percent) and uncertainty-expressing tweets (16 percent). Emotions and personal involvement were abundant in rumor tweets. Expressions of credence and references to URLs were high in counter-rumor tweets. Social ties were found widely in uncertainty-expressing tweets. The high volume and exposure of counter-rumor tweets compared with those of either rumor tweets or uncertainty-expressing tweets highlight the potential of counter-rumors to mitigate rumors.Originality/value This research ventures into a relatively unexplored territory by concurrently examining rumor messages, counter-rumor messages and uncertainty-expressing messages in the wake of a rumor outbreak.

To present a digital method that combines intraoral and face scanning for the computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) fabrication of implant-supported bars for maxillary overdentures. Methods. Over a 2-year period, all patients presenting to a private dental clinic with a removable complete denture in the maxilla, seeking rehabilitation with implants, were considered for inclusion in this study. Inclusion criteria were fully edentulous maxilla, functional problems with the preexisting denture, opposing dentition, and sufficient bone volume to insert four implants. Exclusion criteria were age<55 years, need for bone augmentation, uncompensated diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised status, radio- and/or chemotherapy, and previous treatment with oral and/or intravenous aminobisphosphonates. All patients were rehabilitated with a maxillary overdenture supported by a CAD/CAM polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) implant-supported bar. The outcomes of the study were the passive fit/adaptation of the bar, the 1-year implant survival, and the success rates of the implant-supported overdentures. Results. 15 patients (6 males, 9 females; mean age 68.8±4.7 years) received 60 implants and were rehabilitated with a maxillary overdenture supported by a PEEK bar, designed and milled from an intraoral digital impression. The intraoral scans were integrated with face scans, in order to design each bar with all available patient data (soft tissues, prosthesis, implants, and face) in the correct spatial position. When testing the 3D-printed resin bar, 12 bars out of 15 (80%) had a perfect passive adaptation and fit; in contrast, 3 out of 15 (20%) did not have a sufficient passive fit or adaptation. No implants were lost, for a 1-year survival of 100% (60/60 surviving implants). However, some complications (two fixtures with peri-implantitis in the same patient and two repaired overdentures in two different patients) occurred. This determined a 1-year success rate of 80% for the implant-supported overdenture. Conclusions. In this study, the combination of intraoral and face scans allowed to successfully restore fully edentulous patients with maxillary overdentures supported by 4 implants and a CAD/CAM PEEK bar. Further studies are needed to confirm these outcomes.

Adequate dissemination of correct information about the disease would have helped decrease its spread and the associated panic in the general population. In this study, we looked into the use of YouTube as a resource for providing information about West Nile Virus infection. Objective: This study aims to identify and evaluate YouTube as resource for providing information on West Nile Virus infection to the general public. Methods: YouTube was searched on November 25, 2012, using the keywords West Nile Virus epidemic, West Nile Virus infection, and West Nile Virus prevention for videos uploaded in the past 6 months containing relevant information about the disease. The videos were classified as useful, misleading, or as news updates based on the type of information contained. Total viewership, number of days since upload, total duration of videos, and source of upload were noted. Results: A total of 106 videos with information on West Nile Virus infection were included in the study, with 79.24% having useful information about the disease. Among the useful videos, 51/84 (60.71%) had information on disease prevention, and 29/84 (34.52%) contained information on news and research updates. The majority of these videos were uploaded by individuals (54.6%) or news agencies (41.8 %). Healthcare agencies contributed only 3.4 % of the total videos. Even though the useful videos represented 72% of all videos, there was significantly higher total viewership and viewership per day for the non-useful videos (P<0.05). Conclusions: YouTube may be a significant resource for dissemination of information on public health issues like West Nile virus infection and should be targeted by healthcare agencies for this use. The major drawback of this medium is lack of verification by authorized healthcare professionals before these videos are made available for viewing by the community. Hence, a strict caution should be exercised in obtaining the information from unauthorized videos posted on YouTube.

University students usually overestimate peer alcohol use, resulting in them 'drinking up' to perceived norms. Social norms theory suggests correcting these inflated perceptions can reduce alcohol consumption. Recent findings by the current authors show portraying oneself as 'a drinker' is considered by many students to be a socially desirable component of their Facebook identity, perpetuating an online culture that normalises binge drinking. However, social networking sites have yet to be utilised in social norms interventions. Design and Methods. Actual and perceived descriptive and injunctive drinking norms were collected from 244 university students. Ninety-five students screened positive for hazardous drinking and were randomly allocated to a control group or intervention group that received social norms feedback via personalised Facebook private messages over three sessions. Results. At 1 month post-intervention, the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumed by intervention group during the previous month had significantly reduced compared with baseline and controls. Reductions were maintained 3 months post-intervention. Intervention group perceived drinking norms were significantly more accurate post-intervention. Discussion and Conclusions. This is the first study to test the feasibility of using Facebook to deliver social norms interventions. Correcting misperceptions of peer drinking norms resulted in clinically significant reductions in alcohol use. Facebook has many advantages over traditional social norms delivery, providing an innovative method for tackling problem drinking at university. These results have implications for the use of Facebook to deliver positive messages about safe alcohol use to students, which may counter the negative messages regarding alcohol normally seen on Facebook.

Previous studies, as well as market sales data, show some consumers are willing to pay a premium for redundant or superfluous food labels that carry no additional information for the informed consumer. Some advocacy groups have argued that the use of such redundant labels is misleading or unethical. To determine whether premiums for redundant labels stem from misunderstanding or other factors, this study seeks to determine whether greater knowledge of the claims - in the form of expertise in food production and scientific literacy - decreases willingness to pay for redundant labels. We also explore whether de-biasing information influences consumers' valuations of redundant labels. An online survey of 1122 U.S. consumers elicited preferences for three redundantly labeled products: non-GMO sea salt, gluten-free orange juice, and no-hormone-added chicken breast. Respondents with farm experience report lower premiums for non-GMO salt and no-hormone-added chicken. Those with higher scientific literacy state lower premiums for gluten-free orange juice. However, after providing information about the redundancy of the claims, less than half of respondents who were initially willing to pay extra for the label are convinced otherwise. Over 30% of respondents counter-intuitively increase their premiums, behavior that is associated with less a priori scientific knowledge. The likelihood of ""overpricing"" redundant labels is associated with willingness-to-pay premiums for organic food, suggesting at least some of the premium for organic is a result of misinformation.

Although effective in the lab, they are relatively untested in online experiments, and the quality of responses is largely unexplored. Closed-ended questions are easier to use online because they generally require only single key- or mouse-press responses and are less cognitively demanding, but they can bias the responses. We compared the data quality obtained using open and closed response formats using the continued-influence effect (CIE), in which participants read a series of statements about an unfolding event, one of which is unambiguously corrected later. Participants typically continue to refer to the corrected misinformation when making inferential statements about the event. We implemented this basic procedure online (Exp. 1A, n = 78), comparing standard open-ended responses to an alternative procedure using closed-ended responses (Exp. 1B, n = 75). Finally, we replicated these findings in a larger preregistered study (Exps. 2A and 2B, n = 323). We observed the CIE in all conditions: Participants continued to refer to the misinformation following a correction, and their references to the target misinformation were broadly similar in number across open- and closed-ended questions. We found that participants' open-ended responses were relatively detailed (including an average of 75 characters for inference questions), and almost all responses attempted to address the question. The responses were faster, however, for closed-ended questions. Overall, we suggest that with caution it may be possible to use either method for gathering CIE data.

Thus we propose an improved SIR model and establish the corresponding mean-field equation. By using the differential dynamics method and the next generation matrix theory, the equilibrium point and the basic regeneration number R 0 are calculated. Moreover, the geometric method is used to prove the asymptotic stability of the model at the equilibrium point and the bifurcation phenomenon at R 0 = 1.

This paper explores two case studies of pro-vaccine activism in Australia and the United States (US). It shows how pro-vaccine views and behaviours can take varying forms due to different aims and methods of engagement – oppositional counteractivities in favour of vaccination in Australia, and issue-based advocacy as part of a political alliance in the US. The focus in Australia comes from a pro-science stance and includes 'skeptics' against pseudoscience directly opposing vaccine-critical groups. In the US, the focus takes the form of an issue-specific campaign that has arisen from existing pro-vaccine parent blogs and discussion groups pushing for policy change rather than public confrontation. These case studies exemplify how pro-vaccine activism can take varying forms of either reinforcing the mainstream view or countering digression from it. Drawing on qualitative research, this paper aims to examine the types of practices and strategies employed by activists to voice their support of vaccination, and discusses the means, messages, and motivations of pro-vaccine activism. It ends with an argument for why a study – of public support for in addition to studying public opposition to vaccination – can help to better understand vaccination views and behaviours. These findings have wider implications for the study of counter-activism and the polarisation of civil society groups. Highlights • Pro-vaccine views and behaviours are understudied. • Case studies on pro-vaccine activist groups in Australia and the United States. • Pro-vaccine activism reinforces the mainstream or counters digression from it.

Part I: Regular Papers","","15498328","","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=138417484&site=ehost-live","In this paper, we present a novel physical unclonable function (PUF) design based on cascode current mirror array. By using a single-stage cascode amplifier for each PUF cell, the output impedance can be significantly elevated. Compared with a traditional single-stage amplifier-based current-mode PUF, the proposed structure is capable of generating more polarized voltage value for the output node. With an additional digital buffer, the temporal noise can be well-suppressed, and a rail-to-rail digital output can be provided with high native reliability. Moreover, through operating the transistors at the subthreshold region, the overall power consumption can be dramatically reduced. Featuring a compact footprint of $3.23~\mu \text{m}^{2}$ (i.e. 764 ${F}^{2}$) for each PUF cell, the proposed PUF implementation is validated using 65-nm standard CMOS process. The excellent randomness of the proposed PUF design is verified based on the test results with widely-accepted auto-correlation function and NIST suites. Meanwhile, the PUF’s uniqueness is measured with 10 chip prototypes and reported to be 49.94%. In addition, the fabricated PUF chips were also characterized with various environmental influences. With multiple readout (500 times) under the reference operating temperature of 27 °C and supply voltage of 1.2 V, the native unstable bit ratio is measured to be as low as 1.50%, which can be further improved to 0.79% by adopting the mainstream temporal majority voting (TMV)-based error correction scheme. Besides, we also evaluate the fabricated PUF chips’ reliability under varied operating temperature from −40 °C to 120 °C and supply voltage from 0.95 to 1.3 V. The averaged bit error rate (BER) per 10 °C and BER per 0.1 V are measured to be 0.86% and 1.02%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art implementations, the reliability figure of merit (RFoM) is improved by $1.16\sim 4.29\times $ , with the influences of the temporal noise, the temperature/supply voltage variations and their ranges comprehensively considered.

Although affecting all areas of life, it poses particular problems in the health arena, where it can delay or prevent effective care, in some cases threatening the lives of individuals. While examples of the rapid spread of misinformation date back to the earliest days of scientific medicine, the internet, by allowing instantaneous communication and powerful amplification has brought about a quantum change. In democracies where ideas compete in the marketplace for attention, accurate scientific information, which may be difficult to comprehend and even dull, is easily crowded out by sensationalized news. In order to uncover the current evidence and better understand the mechanism of misinformation spread, we report a systematic review of the nature and potential drivers of health-related misinformation. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus and Google databases to identify relevant methodological and empirical articles published between 2012 and 2018. A total of 57 articles were included for full-text analysis. Overall, we observe an increasing trend in published articles on health-related misinformation and the role of social media in its propagation. The most extensively studied topics involving misinformation relate to vaccination, Ebola and Zika Virus, although others, such as nutrition, cancer, fluoridation of water and smoking also featured. Studies adopted theoretical frameworks from psychology and network science, while co-citation analysis revealed potential for greater collaboration across fields. Most studies employed content analysis, social network analysis or experiments, drawing on disparate disciplinary paradigms. Future research should examine susceptibility of different sociodemographic groups to misinformation and understand the role of belief systems on the intention to spread misinformation. Further interdisciplinary research is also warranted to identify effective and tailored interventions to counter the spread of health-related misinformation online. • Studies on health misinformation mainly relate to vaccine and infectious disease. • Findings show high prevalence and popularity of misinformation on social media. • Theoretical frameworks are drawn on disparate disciplinary paradigms. • Studies employed content analysis, social network analysis or experiments. • More interdisciplinary research needed to understand the susceptibility of users.

Because people only interact with few other individuals, and the structure of these interactions influence spreading processes, the pairwise relationships between individuals can be usefully represented by a network. Although the underlying transmission processes are different, the network approach can be used to study the spread of pathogens in a contact network or the spread of rumours in a social network. We study simulated simple and complex epidemics on synthetic networks and on two empirical networks, a social/contact network in an Indian village and an online social network. Our goal is to learn simultaneously the spreading process parameters and the first infected node, given a fixed network structure and the observed state of nodes at several time points. Our inference scheme is based on approximate Bayesian computation, a likelihood-free inference technique. Our method is agnostic about the network topology and the spreading process. It generally performs well and, somewhat counter-intuitively, the inference problem appears to be easier on more heterogeneous network topologies, which enhances its future applicability to real-world settings where few networks have homogeneous topologies.

Abstract By incorporating the spreading characteristics of cyber rumors over mobile social networks, we newly develop a dynamic system to model rumor spreading dynamics by the compartment method. Specifically, a couple of a user and an attached device is viewed as a node, and all network nodes are separated into four compartments: Rumor-Neutral, Rumor-Received, Rumor-Believed and Rumor-Denied. Some transition parameters among these groups are introduced. Additionally, the role of memory, user's ability to distinguish the rumors and rumor-denier's behavior of refuting rumors are also incorporated. The stability of the equilibria of the model system is addressed, and the influence of model parameters upon the threshold is analyzed. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results, and also motivate us to propose suitable measures to control cyber rumor spreading by properly adjusting the parameter values.

To extend the dynamic range considerably, the already successfully demonstrated concept of a linear self-reset pixel was employed in this work. With the self-reset concept the limit of the maximum analyzable photo generated charge (Qmax⁡) during the exposure time is extended to a multiple of the saturation charge of the photo diode (Qsat) by asynchronous self-resets of the photo diode. Additionally, the remaining charge at the end of the exposure time is evaluated to increase the resolution of the opto-electronic conversion. Thus we achieved pixels with a DR of more than 120 dB combined with an improved low light sensitivity using a pinned photodiode. This paper focuses on two topics: One is the realization and opto-electronic characterization of further self-reset pixel cells for an experimental optimization of the functionality with respect to linearity and high signal-to-noise ratio. The second one is the assembly and digital readout of a cluster structure composed of 16 × 16 pixel matrix on a CMOS test chip. One constraint for later usage of the pixel cells in a high resolution (> VGA) image sensor is the required layout area of the individual circuit blocks. For the cluster structure a size of 20 × 20 µ m 2 for the analog part of the pixel containing the photo diode and the other analog circuit blocks, the comparator and the signal shaping, was desired. The circuit design and layout work included several variants of the pinned photo diode with floating diffusion (FD) readout node, which is also used for analog voltage storage, and different control transistors. Further for the comparator a telescopic differential amplifier with high gain was implemented as well as peripheral 10 bit counter/shift register as static and dynamic versions. Test chips have been fabricated in an advanced 0.18 µ m CMOS technology for optical sensors with low leakage currents. The sensor chips have been evaluated with a specifically developed test setup which gives the flexibility to arbitrarily generate the digital and analog control signals in terms of timing and voltage levels. Based on this, the number of asynchronous self-resets could be read out from the counters of the pixel cells as coarse values. The remaining charge at the end of the integration time was digitized using a ramp analog to digital conversion and could be read out as fine values. An opto-electronic characterization with adjustable illumination from 0 lx to 13 klx was done to measure and analyze the opto-electronic conversion function (OECF) and the noise of six different self-reset pixel cells having the high-gain differential amplifier as comparator. Finally the coarse values of two implemented 16 × 16 pixel clusters could be read out as a mini camera using a lens for optical image formation.

In order to explore intervention strategies, firstly a two-layered network was generated considering real conditions, and its diffusion threshold is calculated based on previous studies. Then, after dividing intervention conditions into before and after the outbreak, intervention strategies were explored from the aspects of network topology and public management. And the results indicated that before the outbreak, the superposition of networks will add to the difficulty in intervention, while an integrated immunization strategy which takes the topology of multiplex network into consideration works well. After the outbreak, the integrated immunization strategy has a relative worse effect. But releasing correct information could receive a better effect on intervention. Besides, releasing correct information in the online network has better effect on the final results than in the offline network. Also, correct information with high acceptance rate will weaken the influence of degree on intervention, which means that nodes with high or low degree have no significant difference in intervention effect.

They hold great potential to promote a new generation of wearable devices and thin optical systems for imaging and sensing. However, due to the diffractive nature of these metasurfaces, chromatic aberration represents a critical challenge toward practical implementations, especially for the visible spectrum. Existing solutions for multi-wavelength meta-optics inevitably increase the device thickness and system complexity, similar to the conventional refractive and diffractive counterparts. They are also limited to polarization sensitive lenses with a small size and numerical aperture (NA). In this manuscript, we present the design of single-layer multi-wavelength metasurfaces using ultrathin dielectric resonators (thickness ≪ wavelength) as structural elements. The electromagnetic response of these resonators can be tailored by the in-plane geometrical parameters and used to manipulate the transmitted light. We introduce a digital transmission modulation scheme which enables opportunities to design multi-wavelength optics beyond conventional binary diffractive optics. The design versatility of our approach is demonstrated by polarization-independent achromatic metalenses with a larger lens size and larger NA than existing approaches. The simplicity of the design and fabrication process makes these ultrathin metasurfaces good candidates for building flat optical elements that can be easily integrated onto CMOS electronics and MEMS devices.

We herein introduce an integration of digital image processing with a model PAD for easing and improving the signal readout procedure. The colorimetric detection mechanism of PAD relies on in-situ induced yellowish silver nanoparticles via the interaction of silver ions, poly(vinyl alcohol), and ammonia with isoniazid. The observed color value is related with the concentration of isoniazid. The proposed algorithm is based on mathematical morphology recognition, and minimizes the errors arising from manual area selection. Besides, it allows the recognition of both circle and square shapes in 96-well plate and A4 size array designs. Since this algorithm automatically provides the blank-corrected numerical matrixes and image profiles of red, green and blue channels, further investigations such as outlier classification, construction of regression/prediction models and calculation of detection limit can be easily performed. Comparison of signal readout results of the developed algorithm with ImageJ software demonstrates significant improvements in analysis speed, reproducibility, accuracy and color values. Therefore, application of the proposed algorithm is promising as a robust technique for practical applications.

Warning labels on cigarette packs might help correct these misperceptions. Methods: We carried out an online study with 1200 smokers (18-62 years old), randomized to 3 conditions: text warning labels, pictorial warning labels and a control group (water bottle labels). Warning labels were based on those proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010. Participants in each condition saw 4 randomly selected labels and rated their expected longevity and chances of surviving to age 75 after exposure. Analyses of covariance controlled for cigarettes per day and self-rated health. Results: Compared to control, both text and pictorial warnings reduced participant's expected longevity (text: mean = 76.8 years, pictorial: 77.3, control 79.4) and their estimated chances of living to 75 (text: 62.0%, pictorial: 63.0%, control 66.5%). The contrast between text and pictorial labels combined and control showed significantly reduced expected longevity (p = .011) and chances of living to 75 (p = .004). Differences between text and pictorial conditions were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Large text or pictorial warnings on cigarette packs might help smokers develop a more accurate understanding of the effects of smoking on their longevity.

US students overestimate how much their peers drink and correcting this through the use of social norm messages may promote responsible drinking. Objectives: We tested whether there is an association between perceived campus drinking norms and usual drinking behavior in UK university students and whether norm messages about responsible drinking correct normative misperceptions and increase students' intentions to drink responsibly. Method: 1,020 UK university students took part in an online study. Participants were exposed to one of five message types: a descriptive norm, an injunctive norm, a descriptive and injunctive norm, or one of two control messages. Message credibility was assessed. Afterwards participants completed measures of intentions to drink responsibly and we measured usual drinking habits and perceptions of peer drinking. Results: Perceptions of peer drinking were associated modestly with usual drinking behavior, whereby participants who believed other students drank responsibly also drank responsibly. Norm messages changed normative perceptions, but not in the target population of participants who underestimated responsible drinking in their peers at baseline. Norm messages did not increase intentions to drink responsibly and although based on accurate data, norm messages were not seen as credible. Conclusions: In this UK based study, although perceived social norms about peer drinking were associated with individual differences in drinking habits, campus wide norm messages about responsible drinking did not affect students' intentions to drink more responsibly. More research is required to determine if this approach can be applied to UK settings.

However, this increasing abundance of data requires supercomputers faster and more powerful than were ever built without the need to build a nuclear plant next to each one! Single flux quantum (SFQ) technology has the potential to meet those booming demands for lower power consumption and higher operation speeds in the electronics industry and future exascale supercomputing systems. Nevertheless, the promised benefits of three orders of magnitude lower power at an order of magnitude higher performance have yet to be attained. In particular, variability and scalability have been long-term obstacles for the technology to advance, compete, and replace the well-founded Silicon CMOS. Notwithstanding that SFQ fabrication has quite improved over the past two decades, its level of variability has to be taken into design consideration. Moreover, the absence of an established tools flow hinders the scalability and the automatibility, which are among the trumps of CMOS technology in digital VLSI. Specifically, as a consequence, ultra-high-speed clocking of large-scale SFQ circuits in the presence of large levels of variability represents a tough obstacle for the technology to advance. In this paper, we propose an innovative self-adaptive clocking technique, which is designed to be resilient in such uncertain environments. Whereas the traditional balanced tree zero-skew clocking is not reliable for large-scale SFQ designs, our proposed hierarchical chains of homogeneous clover-leaves clocking inherits its robustness from spatially correlated cell delays and from the timing robustness of the SFQ traditional counter-flow clocking. Our simulations on ISCAS’85 benchmark circuits show that our robust clocking costs can be on average within 34% as fast as ideal zero-skew jitter-free clock trees with an average area overhead of 58%. Moreover, lower area overhead is also possible at the cost of performance, demonstrating the possible trade-off between performance and area. We assert that these overheads are acceptable given the benefits of more reliable functionality, as quantified by yield, as well as improved scalability. In particular, previous efforts reported that a similar, but more limited, clocking structure leads to up to 93% higher yield than zero-skew clock trees.

This ""increase-decline paradox"" reflects a growing pain of many online communities where the once active users would eventually become less involved after a period of time, despite many attempts to promote sharing. To resolve this paradox, we propose a multidimensional theoretical model that tests possible effects of platform features, cognitive factors and social comparison on sharing. Using three 2 x 2 experiments (N = 647), we note while platform features such as content type and privacy settings contribute to explaining (non-)sharing decisions, the decline is somewhat inevitable due to a chain of cognitive reactions. This is because increasing Facebook use possibly cultivates ambient awareness, which may lead to higher level of presumed influence of sharing that would eventually result in self-censorship. Counterintuitively, this suggests that Facebook environment features have contradictory influence on sharing. Our study also finds very strong third-person effects, which alludes to the perceived undesirability of sharing as a behavior as well as the misperceptions toward others' decision-making, which together discourage sharing.

This calls for low-volume and high-precision liquid handling solutions with ease-of-use and portability. In this article, a new digital droplet pipetting method is introduced for the first time, derived from the microfluidic impact printing principle. Configured as a conventional handheld pipette, the prototype device consists of a plug-and-play and disposable microfluidic pipetting chip, driven by a programmable electromagnetic actuator for on-demand dispensing of nanoliter droplets. In particular, the impact-driven microfluidic pipetting chip, in place of the traditional disposable pipette tips, offers both liquid loading and droplet generation. The printing nozzle has been micro-fabricated using a femtosecond laser with a super-hydrophobic structure, in order to minimize the dispensing residues. As a result of the high-precision droplet dispensing principle, the variations of the dispensed volume have been successfully reduced from 49.5% to 0.6% at 0.1 μL, as compared to its commercial counterparts. A proof-of-concept study for concentration dilution and quantitative analysis of cell drug resistance has been carried out by using the digital droplet pipetting system, demonstrating its potential in a broad range of biomedical applications which require both high precision and low-volume processing.

The amount of people who surf the Internet for health-related purposes is dramatically increasing. Actually, the 'posttruth' phenomenon had interested also the healthcare field, where the quality of the online information is really variable. In addition, the health literacy of people and their consequent capacity to correctly understand and therefore use health-related information is crucial. The quality and usability of information provided by the healthcare organizations online appear very important, in order to avoid the risks of fake news as well as of a misunderstanding of information. The websites can be used as a powerful channel for improving the access to care, the use of healthcare services, the health literacy and the empowerment of people. Methods: By analysing the websites of 167 healthcare organizations from 13 Italian Regions, we verified whatever online communication of Italian public hospitals and local healthcare authorities was readable and comprehensible for people with different level of education and different level of literacy, by using the Gulpease Index and by measuring the adoption of words from the Italian Fundamental Vocabulary the data refers to December 2015. Results: The results showed that, in Italy, the healthcare organisations' online communication is still not structured by taking into consideration literacy and health literacy of people who may surf the Internet. In fact, the websites were difficult to read and understand for people with a low educational level according to both the indexes used. The healthcare organisation's websites appeared built on the healthcare organisations' needs, rather than on those of the potential readers. The healthcare management of the Regions recognized the importance of these findings. For this reason, the Collaborative of the Italian Regions, coordinated by the MeS Laboratory of Sant'Anna School, decided to monitor and evaluate these aspects by introducing specific indicators in the healthcare Performance Evaluation System they voluntarily adopted. Implications: In the 'post-truth' era, it is important to consider the risks of more readable and comprehensible information available on other than the healthcare organisations' websites. This suggests an urgent consideration of the health literacy of people, in addition to their information needs. The availability of our findings was fundamental to inform managers of Italian regional healthcare systems and support them in addressing this issue and working for an equal access to good quality but also comprehensible and readable information online.

Correcting misperceptions by providing feedback has been shown to be an effective intervention for reducing licit drug use. It is currently unknown if social norms interventions are effective in preventing and reducing illicit drug use in European students. The purpose of this paper is to describe the design of a multi-site cluster controlled trial of a web-based social norms intervention aimed at reducing licit and preventing illicit drug use in European university students. Methods/Design: An online questionnaire to assess rates of drug use will be developed and translated based on existing social norms surveys. Students from sixteen universities in seven participating European countries will be invited to complete the questionnaire. Both intervention and control sites will be chosen by convenience. In each country, the intervention site will be the university that the local principal investigator is affiliated with. We aim to recruit 1000 students per site (baseline assessment). All participants will complete the online questionnaire at baseline. Baseline data will be used to develop social norms messages that will be included in a web-based intervention. The intervention group will receive individualized social norms feedback. The website will remain online during the following 5 months. After five months, a second survey will be conducted and effects of the intervention on social norms and drug use will be measured in comparison to the control site. Discussion: This project is the first cross-national European collaboration to investigate the feasibility of a social norms intervention to reduce licit and prevent illicit drug use among European university students.

This content can impact preparedness and response due to the popularity and real-time nature of social media platforms. We sought to explore how the image-sharing platform Instagram is used for information dissemination and conversation during the current Zika outbreak. Study design This was a retrospective review of publicly posted images about Zika on Instagram. Methods Using the keyword ‘#zika’ we identified 500 images posted on Instagram from May to August 2016. Images were coded by three reviewers and contextual information was collected for each image about sentiment, image type, content, audience, geography, reliability, and engagement. Results Of 500 images tagged with #zika, 342 (68%) contained content actually related to Zika. Of the 342 Zika-specific images, 299 were coded as ‘health’ and 193 were coded ‘public interest’. Some images had multiple ‘health’ and ‘public interest’ codes. Health images tagged with #zika were primarily related to transmission (43%, 129/299) and prevention (48%, 145/299). Transmission-related posts were more often mosquito-human transmission (73%, 94/129) than human–human transmission (27%, 35/129). Mosquito bite prevention posts outnumbered safe sex prevention; (84%, 122/145) and (16%, 23/145) respectively. Images with a target audience were primarily aimed at women (95%, 36/38). Many posts (60%, 61/101) included misleading, incomplete, or unclear information about the virus. Additionally, many images expressed fear and negative sentiment, (79/156, 51%). Conclusion Instagram can be used to characterize public sentiment and highlight areas of focus for public health, such as correcting misleading or incomplete information or expanding messages to reach diverse audiences.

As vaccination coverage rates remain suboptimal in several developed countries, and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases become more prevalent, it is important that we build on previous research by analyzing themes in online vaccination discussions, including those that individuals may see without actively searching for information on immunization. Objective: The study aimed to explore the sentiments and themes behind an unsolicited debate on immunization in order to better inform public health interventions countering antivaccination sentiment. Methods: We analyzed and quantified 117 user-driven open-ended comments on immunization posted in the Comments section of a Facebook advertisement that targeted Canadian parents for recruitment into a larger study on immunization. Then, 2 raters coded all comments using content analysis. Results: Of 117 comments, 85 were posted by unique commentators, with most being female (65/85, 77%). The largest proportion of the immunization comments were positive (51/117, 43.6%), followed by negative (41/117, 35.0%), ambiguous (20/117, 17.1%), and hesitant (5/117, 4.3%). Inaccurate knowledge (27/130, 20.8%) and misperceptions of risk (23/130, 17.7%) were most prevalent in the 130 nonpositive comments. Other claims included distrust of pharmaceutical companies or government agencies (18/130, 13.8%), distrust of the health care system or providers (15/130, 11.5%), past negative experiences with vaccination or beliefs (10/130, 7.7%), and attitudes about health and prevention (10/130, 7.7%). Almost 40% (29/74, 39%) of the positive comments communicated the risks of not vaccinating, followed by judgments on the knowledge level of nonvaccinators (13/74, 18%). A total of 10 positive comments (10/74, 14%) specifically refuted the link between autism and vaccination. Conclusions: The presence of more than 100 unsolicited user-driven comments on a platform not intended for discussion, nor providing any information on immunization, illustrates the strong sentiments associated with immunization and the arbitrariness of the online platforms used for immunization debates. Health authorities should be more proactive in finding mechanisms to refute misinformation and misperceptions that are propagating uncontested online. Online debates and communications on immunization need to be identified by continuous monitoring in order for health authorities to understand the current themes and trends, and to engage in the discussion.

The existing analyses of CSR in the alcohol industry point to the misleading nature of these CSR practices. Yet, research has been relatively sparse on how the alcohol industry advances CSR in an attempt to facilitate underlying business interests, and in what ways the ongoing display of industry CSR impacts public health. This paper aims to investigate the alcohol industry's recent CSR engagements and explain how CSR forms part of the industry's wider political and corporate strategies. Methods: Our study used qualitative methods to collect and analyse data. We searched for materials pertaining to CSR activities from websites of three transnational alcohol corporations, social media platforms, media reports and other sources. Relevant documents were thematically analysed with an iterative approach. Results: Our analysis identified three CSR tactics employed by the alcohol companies which are closely tied in with the industry's underlying corporate intents. First, the alcohol manufacturers employ CSR as a means to frame issues, define problems and guide policy debates. In doing this, the alcohol companies are able to deflect and shift the blame from those who manufacture and promote alcoholic products to those who consume them. Second, the alcohol corporations promote CSR initiatives on voluntary regulation in order to delay and offset alcohol control legislation. Third, the alcohol corporations undertake philanthropic sponsorships as a means of indirect brand marketing as well as gaining preferential access to emerging alcohol markets. Conclusions: The increasing penetration and involvement of the alcohol industry into CSR highlights the urgent needs for public health counter actions. Implementation of any alcohol control measures should include banning or restricting the publicity efforts of the industry's CSR and informing the public of the alcohol industry's notion of social responsibility. More significantly, an internationally binding instrument should be called for to enable countries to differentiate between genuine concerns and spurious altruism, and in doing so, resist the industry's attempt to erode alcohol control.

Methods:  Participants were recruited online through an Australian and New Zealand professional eating disorder organisation and community eating disorder organisations and a university in Australia. Assessment was conducted online using the General Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire and SCOFF. Demographic data were also collected. Results:  Dietitians had greater nutrition knowledge than all other health professionals, except medical doctors. Psychologists and dietitians had similar knowledge for choosing everyday foods. Dietitians had greater nutrition knowledge than eating disorder patients and controls in all areas of nutrition knowledge, while other health professionals had similar knowledge to patients. Patients with eating disorders had greater knowledge of sources of nutrients than controls. Conclusions:  Australian health professionals exhibited higher levels of nutrition knowledge than health professionals in previous studies in other countries. However, non-dietitian health professionals had similar levels of knowledge to individuals with eating disorders. Training and continuing education in nutrition is needed so health professionals can confidently identify when a patient has misleading information about nutrition and either correct the misinformation or refer the patient on to a qualified dietitian.

Corrections were more effective among those higher in initial misperceptions. Notably, organizational credibility was not reduced when correcting misinformation, making this a low-cost behavior for public health organizations.

In light of marketplace changes (i.e. labeling requirements), we explore behavioral measures based on labeling options.Design/methodology/approach Three studies, one online projective survey using a convenience sample of consumers and two experiments conducted with Amazon mTurk adult US participants, are included.Findings Consumers have negative associations with GM products vs non-GM and are more likely to purchase unlabeled GM products. GM products may offer positive economic, societal and environmental benefits. However, the need for labeling overshadows these benefits and presence of GM labeling increased avoidance. Furthermore, changes in product opinion mediate consumers' purchase intention and willingness to pay.Research limitations/implications GM labeling negatively influences consumers' opinions and behavioral intentions. This is important for legislators and marketers concerned with counter-labeling effects (e.g. Non-GMO Project Verified).Practical implications Debates on efficacy of labeling, inclusion disclosure of ingredients, short-term risks and long-term implications are ongoing globally. Consumer reception and purchase intention can only be changed through governmental and corporate transparency.Social implications Widespread misinformation about GM foods, presence in our food supply, impact on health, economy, environment and the marketplace still exists.

First, we critically discuss the most important definitions of the umbrella term fake news, in the so-called post-truth era, in order to emphasize different challenges in conceptualizing this elusive social phenomenon. Second, employing some valuable contribution from literature, we present and illustrate with vivid examples 10 categories of fake news. Each type of fake news is discussed in the context of organizational communication. Based on existent literature, we propose a 3D conceptual model of fake news, in an organizational context. Furthermore, we consider that PR managers can use either reactive PR strategies to counteract online fake news regarding an organization, or communication stratagems to temporarily transform the organization served into a potential source of fake news. The existing typology of reactive public relations strategies from the literature allow us to discuss the challenge of using them in counteracting online fake news. Each reactive PR strategy can be a potential solution to respond to different types of online fake news. Although these possibilities seem to be extensive, in some cases, PR managers can find them ineffective. In our view, this cluster of reactive PR strategies is not a panacea for managing fake news in the online environment and different strategic approaches may be need, such as communication stratagems. In this context, communication stratagems consist in using organization as a source or as a vector for strategic creation and dissemination of online fake news, for the benefit of the organization. We conclude that within online environment PR managers can employ a variety of reactive PR strategies to counteract fake news, or different communication stratagems to achieve organizational goals.

Instead, fake news has an intricately entwined relationship with online partisan media, both responding and setting its issue agenda. In 2016, partisan media appeared to be especially susceptible to the agendas of fake news, perhaps due to the election. Emerging news media are also responsive to the agendas of fake news, but to a lesser degree. Fake news coverage itself is diverging and becoming more autonomous topically. While fact-checkers are autonomous in their selection of issues to cover, they were not influential in determining the agenda of news media overall, and their influence appears to be declining, illustrating the difficulties fact-checkers face in disseminating their corrections.

The electro-migration of Br− ions toward the anode and their reaction with the contact have been long known to adversely influence the lifetime of TlBr devices. We report on the performance of TlBr devices with Tl contacts which minimizes the effects of polarization. Results indicate that vapor-deposited Tl contacts are highly ohmic and adhere strongly to TlBr. Long-term lifetime tests were performed under alternating bias with a 17.4- $\mu $ Hz duty cycle. Unlike devices with Pt and Au contacts, devices with Tl do not exhibit the short-term (in the order of hundreds of hours) fluctuations in the spectroscopic response. Furthermore, these devices show a stable behavior and can work under much lower electric fields. Energy resolution in the range of 2%–2.5% at 662 keV was obtained using virtual Frisch grid (10 mm thick) and pixelated (5.5 mm thick) TlBr devices with Tl contacts without any digital correction at room temperature.

This study aims to design, fabricate, and develop a novel on-chip ROS detection based on mounted in-house built fluorescence microscope in microfluidics, which has not been reported previously. An in-house 3D printed built digital portable fluorescence type microscope for on-chip ROS detection has been developed. The combined use of the fluorescence microscope and a glass-based microfluidic chip both enabled to provide high-quality images of the living cells with ease of controlling and handling of the biological sample. As an evidence of the fluorescence microscope, breast cancer cells were loaded with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA, 50 μM) for 45 min on-chip which produces green fluorescence upon reaction with intracellular ROS. Fluorescence of the MCF-7 cells has been captured to obtain a profile of ROS generation for 1 day. LabVIEW 2019 was used along with its high-performance image analysis and IMAQ Vision tools. The viability of the cells was performed by LIVE/DEAD assay and Luna cell counter. The developed platform provides real-time monitoring and quantification of ROS. A strong linear correlation between concentrations versus fluorescence has been recorded. This result recommends that the current microfluidic chip provides an in-vitro platform for the assessment of cell cycle progression and evaluation of the variety of drugs.

The perpetrator's goal for the behavior is to meet personal emotional needs by forcing unnecessary or misguided medical or psychological treatment. Generally, a mother is the perpetrator and her child is the victim. There is a serious lack of research into most aspects of MCA, and this study is the first to utilize the anonymity of an Internet forum to investigate victims' first‐hand experiences of, and the public's opinions about, suspected and confirmed MCA. Three‐hundred and fifty‐six posts by 348 members were explored and coded using formal qualitative content analysis. By accessing an open‐thought online forum, this paper acquired information regarding social perceptions about the nonperpetrating partners who are unaware of the maltreatment; the disturbing and counterintuitive phenomenon of MCA itself; and the resistance often faced by those who attempt to report it.

Personalised normative feedback (PNF) aims to correct this misperception by providing information about personal drinking levels and patterns compared with norms in similar aged peer groups. PNF is intended to raise motivation for behaviour change and has been highlighted for alcohol misuse prevention by the British Government Behavioural Insight Team. The objective of the trial was to assess the effectiveness of PNF with college students for the prevention of alcohol misuse. Methodology: Solomon three-group randomised controlled trial. 1751 students, from 22 British Universities, allocated to a PNF group, a normal control group, or a delayed measurement control group to allow assessment of any measurement effects. PNF was provided by email. Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline, 6- and 12-months (only 12-months for the delayed measurement controls). Drinking behaviour measures were (i) alcohol disorders; (ii) frequency; (iii) typical quantity, (iv) weekly consumption; (v) alcohol-related problems; (vi) perceived drinking norms; and (vii) positive alcohol expectancies. Analyses focused on high-risk drinkers, as well as all students, because of research evidence for the prevention paradox in student drinkers. Principal Findings: Follow-up rates were low, with only 50% and 40% responding at 6- and 12-months, respectively, though comparable to similar European studies. We found no evidence for any systematic attrition bias. Overall, statistical analyses with the high risk sub-sample, and for all students, showed no significant effects of the intervention, at either time-point, in a completed case analysis and a multiple imputation analysis. Conclusions: We found no evidence for the effectiveness of PNF for the prevention of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems in a UK student population.

At the current state of the art, quantum bits (qubits) are fabricated, initialized, controlled, read out and coupled to each other in simple circuits. This enables the realization of basic logic gates, the creation of complex entangled states and the demonstration of algorithms or error correction. Using different variants of low-noise parametric amplifiers, dispersive quantum non-demolition single-shot readout of single-qubit states with high fidelity has enabled continuous and discrete feedback control of single qubits. Here we realize full deterministic quantum teleportation with feed-forward in a chip-based superconducting circuit architecture. We use a set of two parametric amplifiers for both joint two-qubit and individual qubit single-shot readout, combined with flexible real-time digital electronics. Our device uses a crossed quantum bus technology that allows us to create complex networks with arbitrary connecting topology in a planar architecture. The deterministic teleportation process succeeds with order unit probability for any input state, as we prepare maximally entangled two-qubit states as a resource and distinguish all Bell states in a single two-qubit measurement with high efficiency and high fidelity. We teleport quantum states between two macroscopic systems separated by 6 mm at a rate of 104 s−1, exceeding other reported implementations. The low transmission loss of superconducting waveguides is likely to enable the range of this and other schemes to be extended to significantly larger distances, enabling tests of non-locality and the realization of elements for quantum communication at microwave frequencies. The demonstrated feed-forward may also find application in error correction schemes.

Strangely, despite the well-recognized importance of antioxidants, currently there is no international standard index for labeling owing to the lack of standardized methods for antioxidant measurement in complex products. Here, an online high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based method to detect and measure the total antioxidant capacity of antioxidant samples is presented. In this approach, complex samples containing antioxidants are separated by the HPLC system, which is further coupled to an antioxidant measuring system consisting of an optical oxygen sensor, laccase, and tetramethoxy azobismethylene quinone (TMAMQ). The antioxidants, separated via HPLC, reduce TMAMQ to syringaldazine, which is then reoxidized by laccase while simultaneously consuming O. The amount of consumed oxygen is directly proportional to the concentration of antioxidants and is measured by the optical oxygen sensor. The sensor is fabricated by coating a glass capillary with an oxygen-sensitive thin layer made of platinum(II) meso-tetra(4-fluorophenyl)tetrabenzoporphyrin and polystyrene, which makes real-time analysis possible ( t = 1.1 s in solution). Four selected antioxidants (3 mM), namely, catechin, ferulic acid, naringenin (used as a control), and Trolox, representing flavonol, hydrocinnamic acid, flavanone, and vitamin E, respectively, were injected into the online antioxidant monitoring system, separated, and then mixed with the TMAMQ/laccase solution, which resulted in oxygen consumption. This study shows that, with the use of such a system, the antioxidant activity of individual antioxidant molecules in a sample and their contribution to the total antioxidant activity of the sample can be correctly assigned.

Smoke emissions and exposure monitoring is critical for public and environmental health protection; however, ground-level measurements of smoke from wildfires and prescribed fires has proven difficult, as existing (validated) monitoring technologies are expensive, cumbersome, and generally require line power. Few ground-based measurements are made during fire events, which limits our ability to assess the environmental and human health impacts of wildland fire smoke. The objective of this work was to develop and validate an Outdoor Aerosol Sampler (OAS) - a filter-based air sampler that has been miniaturized and weatherproofed. This sampler was designed to overcome several of the technical challenges of wildland fire monitoring by being relatively inexpensive and solar powered. The sampler design objectives were achieved by leveraging low-cost electronic components, open-source programming platforms, and in-house fabrication methods. A direct-reading PM2.5 sensor was selected and integrated with the OAS to provide time-resolved concentration data. Cellular communications established via Short Message Service (SMS) technology were utilized in transmitting online sensor readings and controlling the sampling device remotely. A Monte Carlo simulation aided in the selection of battery and solar power necessary to independently power the OAS, while keeping cost and size to a minimum. Thirteen OAS were deployed to monitor smoke concentrations downwind from a large prescribed fire. Aerosol mass concentrations were interpolated across the monitoring network to depict smoke concentration gradients in the vicinity of the fire. Strong concentration gradients were observed (spatially and temporally) and likely present due to a combination of changing fire location and intensity, topographical features (e.g. mountain ridges), and diurnal weather patterns. Gravimetric filter measurements made by the OAS (when corrected for filter collection efficiency) showed relatively good agreement with measurements from an EPA federal equivalent monitor. However, the real-time optical sensor (Sharp GP2Y1023AU0F) within the OAS suffered from temperature dependence, drift, and imprecision.

The wisdom of crowds corrects the inflation of the ratings. Abstract Vendors on online shopping platforms have incentives to provide misinformation by manipulating consumer ratings. However, few studies have empirically examined whether temporal self-boosting rating manipulation changes the follow-up dynamic pattern of online ratings. This study empirically identifies manipulated ratings and examines how this manipulation influences the evolution of follow-up ratings over time. Rating records of more than 30,000 restaurants are extracted from the server log of a restaurant review website. The results show a statistically nonsignificant difference in the average rating scores between before and after manipulation, indicating that manipulation does not influence follow-up rating dynamics. Moreover, the difference in average ratings between before and after manipulation decreases within a long time window, which indicates that the long-term effect is weaker than the short-term one. The results are further validated by an online field experiment. We then construct a simulation model to reveal the underlying mechanisms of why the follow-up raters could correct the bias of rating manipulation. The manipulated high-rating score of the vendor will increase the diversity of consumers' individual preferences, which leads to diverse evaluations among users. The aggregation of online ranking by taking the average score of ratings helps form a decentralized climate of opinion and finally helps correct the biased rating. This study challenges the common belief that self-boosting misinformation affects the performance of online commerce. The nonsignificant effect of rating manipulation on rating dynamics echoes the theory of the wisdom of crowds. Furthermore, this study has managerial implications for both online vendors and online rating platforms. We suggested that the system should degrade social influences among users in order to reduce the possible impacts by manipulated ratings.

A Case Study of a User-Centerd Design Experience for Mechanical Engineering and Early Childhood Education Students.","Proceedings of the ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition","","21535868","","http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=125730374&site=ehost-live","Interdisciplinary collaboration between undergraduate students in engineering and nonengineering disciplines is mutually beneficial. For the engineering students, such collaborations provide opportunities to practice effective communication and to utilize their technical expertise in a broader social and societal context; and, for the non-engineers, collaboration demystifies the engineering profession, contextualizes prior STEM knowledge, and, in some instances, allows for the physical realization of concepts through hands-on design and prototyping. The benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration are best realized when students view each other's respective skillsets and chosen professions as being valuable and necessary in achieving the ultimate goals of the group. The origin and nature of students' beliefs about dissimilar professions warrants further investigation, particularly as it relates to interdisciplinary collaborative experiences, which have the potential to reshape, either positively or negatively, a priori beliefs about peer collaborators. The purpose of this case study was to characterize the impact of an interdisciplinary collaboration on engineering and non-engineering undergraduate students' perceptions of their peers in dissimilar professions. The setting for the study was a mid-sized, research-intensive land grant university in the eastern US, where second and third-year mechanical engineering (ME) and early childhood education (ECE) students were placed on interdisciplinary teams and tasked with designing and fabricating a novel toy for young children that promotes constructive play. Online surveys were administered prior to and after this one semester course and focused on: (1) a priori knowledge and experience of the other group's subject area; (2) effect of interdisciplinary project on interest in other group's subject area; and (3) perceptions of other group's profession and/or their skills. Survey results showed that neither ME nor ECE students had a prior exposure to the other discipline. After completing the course, ME students perceived that they knew more about child development, play, and the design of children's toys, and ECE students reported they better understood the types of engineering disciplines. Interesting, ECE students less positively rated their ME counterparts post versus pre-course in the following areas: ""very good at math & science,"" ""hardworking,"" ""good communicators,"" and ""intense."" Both ECE and ME students finished the course with balanced perceptions of their own disciplines relative to their counterparts. Both ECE and ME cohorts, on average, agreed that their counterparts' professions were equally legitimate and disagreed that there was a discrepancy in rigor between ECE and ME. ECE students solidly agreed that ME was a more valued discipline, although ME students were more neutral on this view. These findings suggest that engineering students have little content knowledge or experience in disparate fields, such as in this case child development and education, and benefit from interdisciplinary collaboration both in terms of content knowledge and developing a healthy appreciation for outside expertise. The collaboration also benefited the non-engineering students by demystifying the field of engineering, potentially alleviating ""imposter syndrome"" by normalizing team performance expectations, and providing some literacy of the engineering design process. In the case of early childhood education students, these altered perceptions of the engineering discipline may have impact on their self-efficacy for teaching science and engineering (Maier et al., 2013; Kallery 2004; Watters et al., 2000); as such their teaching in these two content areas may positively influence the perceptions of engineering by their future students, particularly females and minorities. This study adds to the growing body of research on the benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration at the undergraduate level, particularly as it relates to shifting perceptions of the involved disciplines (Brown et al., 2014; Burrows, 2015; Falloon and Trewern, 2013; Harris Willcuts, 2009; Jeanpierre et al., 2005; and Lee, 2004.

Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust.

A typical wireless sensing system, however, may require considerable complexity to perform the necessary analog to digital conversion and subsequent wireless transmission. Alternatively, in the case of inductive link based systems, large, manually operated impedance analyzers are required. Based on a detailed analysis of the link impedance, this paper proposes a simple method for wireless capacitive sensing through an inductive link that uses a self-oscillator and a frequency counter. The method enables changes in capacitance to be sensed and wirelessly transmitted simultaneously. In order to test the effectiveness of the method, a self-oscillating circuit was designed and fabricated in $0.18~\mu \text{m}$ CMOS, and combined with an on-chip humidity sensing capacitor. The system was tested in a humidity chamber across a range of 20–90%rh. Measured results from the system demonstrate that capacitive changes as small as 28 fF, translating to <2%rh, can be resolved, with a power consumption of 1.44 mW.

Lessons learnt from disasters and emergencies that occurred globally in the last few years have shown that social media tools may serve as an integral and significant component of crisis response. Communication is one of the fundamental tools of emergency management. It becomes crucial when there are dozens of agencies and organizations responding to a disaster. Regardless of the type of emergency, whether a terrorist attack, a hurricane or an earthquake, communication lines may be overloaded and cellular networks overwhelmed as too many people attempt to use them to access information. Social scientists have presented that post-disaster active public participation was largely altruistic, including activities such as search and rescue, first aid treatment, victim evacuation, and on-line help. Social media provides opportunities for engaging citizens in the emergency management by both disseminating information to the public and accessing information from them. During emergency events, individuals are exposed to large quantities of information without being aware of their validity or risk of misinformation, but users are usually swift to correct them, thus making the social media “self-regulating”.

Proof-of-concept demonstrations have indicated the potential of sc-SWCNTs for digital electronics, radiofrequency circuits, radiation hard memory, improved sensors, and flexible, stretchable, conformable electronics. Advances toward commercial applications bring numerous opportunities in SWCNT materials development and characterization as well as fabrication processes and printing technologies. Commercialization in electronics will require large quantities of sc-SWCNTs, and the challenge for materials science is the development of scalable synthesis, purification, and enrichment methods. While a few synthesis routes have shown promising results in making near-monochiral SWCNTs, gram quantities are available only for small-diameter sc-SWCNTs, which underperform in transistors. Most synthesis routes yield mixtures of SWCNTs, typically 30% metallic and 70% semiconducting, necessitating the extraction of sc-SWCNTs from their metallic counterparts in high purity using scalable postsynthetic methods. Numerous routes to obtain high-purity sc-SWCNTs from raw soot have been developed, including density-gradient ultracentrifugation, chromatography, aqueous two-phase extraction, and selective DNA or polymer wrapping. By these methods (termed sorting or enrichment), >99% sc-SWCNT content can be achieved. Currently, all of these approaches have drawbacks and limitations with respect to electronics applications, such as excessive dilution, expensive consumables, and high ionic impurity content. Excess amount of dispersant is a common challenge that hinders direct inclusion of sc-SWCNTs into electronic devices. At present, conjugated polymer extraction may represent the most practical route to sc-SWCNTs. By the use of polymers with a conjugated backbone, sc-SWCNTs with >99.9% purity can be dispersed in organic solvents via a simple sonication and centrifugation process. With 1000 times less excipient and the flexibility to accommodate a broad range of solvents via diverse polymer constructs, inks are readily deployable in solution-based fabrication processes such as aerosol spray, inkjet, and gravure. Further gains in sc-SWCNT purity, among other attributes, are possible with a better understanding of the structure--property relationships that govern conjugated polymer extraction. This Account covers three interlinked topics in SWCNT electronics: metrology, enrichment, and SWCNT transistors fabricated via solution processes. First, we describe how spectroscopic techniques such as optical absorption, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy are applied for sc-SWCNT purity assessment. Stringent requirements for sc-SWCNTs in electronics are pushing the techniques to new levels while serving as an important driver toward the development of quantitative metrology. Next, we highlight recent progress in understanding the sc-SWCNT enrichment process using conjugated polymers, with special consideration given to the effect of doping on the mechanism. Finally, developments in sc-SWCNT-based electronics are described, with emphasis on the performance of transistors utilizing random networks of sc-SWCNTs as the semiconducting channel material. Challenges and advances associated with using polymer-based dielectrics in the unique context of sc-SWCNT transistors are presented. Such transistor packages have enabled the realization of fully printed transistors as well as transparent and even stretchable transistors as a result of the unique and excellent electrical and mechanical properties of sc-SWCNTs.

The results show a chemical-reaction controlled fiber/matrix interface in the as-fabricated composite, leading to pretty strong interfacial shear strength (~ 537 MPa), measured by the fiber push-in tests. Interfacial engineering by chemical vapor deposited pyrocarbon interphase can effectively hinder the interfacial reactions and weaken the interfacial interactions. The low shear strength of the tailored fiber/matrix interface (~ 155 MPa) could trigger the toughening mechanisms like interface debonding, fiber pull-out, etc., when the composite was subjected to external bending stresses.

Timely access to EC pills is critical because they are more likely to work the sooner they are taken. This study assesses whether LNG EC is sold in accordance with current Food and Drug Administration regulations. Methods We distributed an online questionnaire through an EC-focused listserv for reproductive health professionals, asking data collectors to visit local stores and document product names, price, over-the-counter shelf availability, and misinformation about age restrictions. We used χ 2 analysis to assess bivariate associations and t tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to determine differences in means. Results We collected information about 220 stores. The majority (65%) stocked EC on over-the-counter shelves, although only 22% of these displayed it without a locked security enclosure. Chain pharmacies were more likely to shelf-stock EC than independent pharmacies (77% vs. 5%; p = .000), but variation existed among stores within the same chain. Among stores that were asked, 40% incorrectly reported an age restriction for non-prescription purchase of LNG EC, whereas 95% correctly reported that men can buy LNG EC. The average price of branded and generic LNG EC was $49.64 and $40.05, respectively. Conclusions Changes in the regulatory status of LNG EC have resulted in widespread confusion about how EC can be sold, and its high price contributes to access barriers. Retailers should ensure that consumers can access LNG EC quickly and easily by stocking the product on over-the-counter shelves and educating staff about current regulations.

On-chip timing references are well-known and understood, but for imaging systems where several thousands of pixels require seamless references, area and power consumption limit the use of more traditional synthesizers, such as phase/delay-locked loops (PLLs/DLLs). Other methods, such as relative timing measurement (start/stop), require constant foreground calibration, which is not feasible for outdoor applications, where conditions of temperature, background illumination, etc. can change drastically and frequently. In this paper, a scalable reference generation and synchronization is provided, using minimum resources of area and power, while being robust to mismatches. The suitability of this approach is demonstrated through the design of an 8 × 8 time-to-digital converter (TDC) array, distributed over 1.69 mm2, fabricated using TSMC 65 nm technology (1.2 V core voltage and 4 metal layers—3 thin + 1 thick). Each TDC is based on a ring oscillator (RO) coupled to a ripple counter, occupying a very small area of 550 μ m2, while consuming 500 μ W of power, and has 2 μ s range, 125 ps least significant bit (LSB), and 14-bit resolution. Phase and frequency locking among the ROs is achieved, while providing 18 dB phase noise improvement over an equivalent individual oscillator. The integrated root mean square (RMS) jitter is less than 9 ps, the instantaneous frequency variation is less than 0.11%, differential nonlinearity (DNL) is less than 2 LSB, and integral nonlinearity (INL) is less than 3 LSB.

The parameter Q is tuned online by a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm so that it converges to the desired value. An adaptive optical system with a prototype MFDM is setup to verify the effectiveness of the adaptive controller. The control performance is also compared with a H ∞ controller to show the improvement of the wavefront residue RMS error.

The main objectives of this work are to examine the sliding bubble behaviour outside a horizontal tube through a visualisation experiment and to establish a force balance model for predicting the sliding bubble velocity. Of interest here, the sliding bubble velocity is included in a mechanistic boiling heat transfer model and it varies with the bubble volume, location of the nucleation site, generation frequency of the bubble, etc. In order to predict the sliding velocity of the bubbles generated under the various conditions, a model developed based on the physical mechanism is required. This paper presents experimental techniques and measurement results for observing vapour bubble sliding phenomena. A specially devised flexible heater was fabricated and attached on a rod in order to control the bubble generation location. With the heater and a digital image processing technique, accurate measurement of the bubble volume and velocity became facilitated. Through the experiment, the life cycles of a single bubble was clearly visualised including the birth, departure, sliding, and lift-off. The force balance model which includes the curvature effect in cylindrical coordinate was derived to predict the sliding bubble velocity in the experiment. The equation of the model was based on the balance of circumferential directional forces acting on a sliding bubble with a correction of the local liquid velocity to consider the wake generated by a preceding bubble. The force balance analysis showed that the dominant forces are the buoyancy, quasi-steady drag, and added mass forces. The proposed model was validated by comparing the predicted bubble velocity with the experimental data and it predicted the bubble velocity with satisfactory accuracy. In addition, the force balance analysis found that the sliding bubble velocity correlates well with the bubble generation location when it was non-dimensionalised in a form of Froude number.

Web moderators with a background in behavioral health are used to facilitate peer conversation to promote a sense of community, provide social support, and ensure safety. Objective: Although moderation is a core component of this intervention, little is known on best practices for moderators to ensure safety while encouraging engagement. This study sought to describe interactions between moderators and peer users and understand moderator experiences through individual interviews. Methods: Adolescents and young adults aged 14 to 26 years with depression or anxiety history were recruited for a usability study of the SOVA intervention. During this study, 14 moderators were trained to regularly review comments to blog posts for safety, facilitate conversation, and correct misinformation. A total of 110 blog posts and their associated comments were extracted and coded using a codebook based on items from the supportive accountability model and a peer social support analysis. Closing interviews with 12 moderators assessing their experience of moderating were conducted, recorded, and transcribed. Blog post text and comments as well as transcripts of moderator interviews were assessed using a thematic analysis approach, and blog posts were examined for trends in content of moderator comments comparing blog posts with differences in comment contributor order. Results: There were no safety concerns during the study, and moderators only intervened to remove identifiable information. Web moderators exhibited elements of supportive accountability (such as being perceived as experts and using verbal rewards as well as offering informational and emotional support). When the moderators provided the last comment under a blog post, thereby potentially ending contribution by users, they were at times found to be commenting about their own experiences. Moderators interviewed after completing their role expressed challenges in engaging users. A cohort of moderators who received more extensive training on supportive accountability and peer social support felt their ability to engage users improved because of the training. Conclusions: Moderators of a Web-based support site for adolescents with depression or anxiety were able to ensure safety while promoting user engagement. Moderators can elicit user engagement by offering gratitude and encouragement to users, asking users follow-up questions, and limiting their own opinions and experiences when responding to comments.

The study has three main goals: Determining the prevalence of CAMEO, studying its detailed characteristics, and inferring the motivation(s) for using it. For the physics course that we studied, about 10% of the certificate earners used this method to obtain more than 1% of their correct answers, and more than 3% of the certificate earners used it to obtain the majority (>50%) of their correct answers. We discuss two of the likely consequences of CAMEO: jeopardizing the value of MOOC certificates as academic credentials, and generating misleading conclusions in educational research. Based on our study, we suggest methods for reducing CAMEO. Although this study was conducted on a MOOC, CAMEO can be used in any learning environment that enables students to have multiple accounts.

In particular, it should be able (1) to maximize the discovery of association rules amongst data items and (2) to handle the rapid growing data scale. The FP-Growth algorithm is a salient association rule learning method in exploring potential relation in database possibly with a lack of priori knowledge. It has the merits of low time & space complexity, whereas it cannot handle negative association rules which is necessary in comprehensive mining of health data. In order to enable comprehensive discovery of association rules, this study extends the FP-Growth algorithm to mine both positive and negative frequent patterns, namely the PNFP-Growth framework. The extended approach also adopts a prune strategy to filter out misleading patterns to the most by correlating the negative data items and the positive ones. Experiments had been performed to evaluate the performance of the PNFP-Growth over a public data set and a database consisting of thousands of people's real health examination information (collected within 5 years from the date of this publication). The results indicate that (1) the PNFP-Growth can excavate more patterns than the traditional counterpart does while it is still highly efficient, and (2) the analysis upon the health examination data is informative and well complies with the clinical practices, e.g., more than 30 % people suffering from hypertension are having high systolic pressure and liver problems.

Twitter can promote scholarly discussion, disseminate research rapidly, and extend and diversify the scope of audiences reached. However, scientists also caution that if Twitter does not accurately convey science due to the inherent brevity of this media, misinformation could cascade quickly through social media. Data on whether Twitter effectively communicates conservation science and the types of user groups receiving these tweets are lacking. To address these knowledge gaps, we examined live tweeting as a means of communicating conservation science at the 2013 International Congress for Conservation Biology (ICCB). We quantified and compared the user groups sending and reading live tweets. We also surveyed presenters to determine their intended audiences, which we compared with the actual audiences reached through live tweeting. We also asked presenters how effectively tweets conveyed their research findings. Twitter reached 14 more professional audience categories relative to those attending and live tweeting at ICCB. However, the groups often reached through live tweeting were not the presenters' intended audiences. Policy makers and government and non-governmental organizations were rarely reached (0%, 4%, and 6% of audience, respectively), despite the intent of the presenters. Plenary talks were tweeted about 6.9 times more than all other oral or poster presentations combined. Over half the presenters believed the tweets about their talks were effective. Ineffective tweets were perceived as vague or missing the presenters' main message. We recommend that presenters who want their science to be communicated accurately and broadly through Twitter should provide Twitter-friendly summaries that incorporate relevant hashtags and usernames. Our results suggest that Twitter can be used to effectively communicate speakers' findings to diverse audiences beyond conference walls.

At present, for this proposes, typically 3-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) is often used. This technique employs two cameras acquiring images from different viewing angles of the object while it is deformed. The cameras have to be perfectly synchronized and calibrated for both: 3D reconstruction and for tracking each surface element while the deformation occurs. The calibration process of the technique requires acquiring a sequence of several images of a calibration object and a high amount of computational resources. Alternative techniques have been proposed to obtain 3D displacement maps by combining Fringe Projection (FP) with two-dimensional DIC (2D-DIC). The hybrid technique only requires one camera and a fringe projector. In this thesis it is presented a novel device that allows obtaining the maps of displacements in X-, Y- and Z- direction at the surface of an object during deformation. The system is based on a method that combines 2D-DIC and FP to obtain the in- and out-of-plane components of displacement during deformation. The device operates by acquiring only one image of the studied object at each deformation state desired to analyze during the total test, thereby allowing real time data acquisition. The goal of the presented work is that the device allows both: a precise perpendicular alignment respect to a flat reference surface, and a self-calibration (i.e. no calibration object is employed). Thus, a fringe calibration constant is estimated for each pixel as well as all the required parameters for the in-plane displacement correction. To illustrate the potential of the proposed device, a set of static and dynamic experiments have been conducted using hyperelastic materials. The maximum out-of-plane displacement achieved was 20 mm with an uncertainty of 0,023 mm and an in-plane displacement uncertainty of 0,0083 mm. Results have been compared with those obtained using a commercial three dimensional digital image correlation system showing a very high level of agreement.

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is increasingly used for topographic surveys due to the ability to acquire high resolution data over spatially-extensive areas. This capability is ideally suited to saltmarsh environments, which are often vast, inaccessible systems where topographic variations can be very subtle. Derivation of surface (DSMs) (ground elevation plus vegetation) versus terrain (bare ground elevation) models (DTMs) relies on the ability of the LiDAR sensor to accurately record multiple returns. In saltmarshes however, the dense stands of low (< 1 m) vegetation commonly found precludes the acquisition of more than one return, and the resulting DTM is not different to the DSM. Establishing the offset between ground and vegetation surface in order to correct the LiDAR-derived DTM can be challenging due to the spatial variability in saltmarsh habitats. Here we show the development and application of a habitat-specific correction factor (HSCF) for the Odiel Saltmarshes using a combination of habitat object-based classification (82% overall accuracy) and ground control surveys that reduces the DTM error to within that associated with the LiDAR sensor (average error 0.1 m). We also show that the true accuracy of supplied (unmodified) DTMs can be >0.5 m in saltmarshes dominated by dense vegetation such as Spartina densiflora. In particular, global projections of sea-level rise across the next 80 years (0.18-0.59 m) significantly overlaps this accuracy margin, implying that assessments and modelling of sea-level impacts in saltmarsh systems will likely be erroneous if based on Lidar-derived DTMs. Erroneous assumptions and conclusions can result if the real accuracy of DTMs (bare ground) on vegetated saltmarshes is not considered, and the consequences of the propagation of this misinformation through to management decisions should not be over-looked.

In this study, the rumor diffusion in the homogeneous and heterogeneous social networks has been explored, introducing the concept of an anti-rumor spreading agent as the mitigator. The study consists of four types of individuals within the population, namely, spreaders, mitigators, ignorants, and stiflers. To model the interactions among the aforesaid populations, five mathematical models have been proposed for the rumor diffusion process in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. The proposed SMIR model has been solved using Runge-Kutta fourth-order method and then the model has been extended into a fuzzy environment to deal with the inherent uncertainties. The spreading of a rumor is a socio-psychological phenomenon which may contain delay in the process. To investigate this, the SMIR model has been transformed into a delayed SMIR model. In the heterogeneous environment, the SMIR model has been extended in a small world and scale-free networks. The results obtained are analyzed in all the cases and found that mitigator plays a critical role to control the spread of rumor in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. • Objective: to explore the spread of rumors on social networks. • Four population: spreaders, mitigators, ignorants, and stiflers. • The fuzzy paradigm has been used to remove uncertainties. • The results are obtained from homogeneous and heterogeneous environmnet.

Analysis of spatially distributed particles on these devices typically requires microscopy negating the cost and size advantages of microfluidic assays. In this paper, we introduce a scalable electronic sensor technology, called microfluidic CODES, that utilizes resistive pulse sensing to orthogonally detect particles in multiple microfluidic channels from a single electrical output. Combining the techniques from telecommunications and microfluidics, we route three coplanar electrodes on a glass substrate to create multiple Coulter counters producing distinct orthogonal digital codes when they detect particles. We specifically design a digital code set using the mathematical principles of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) telecommunication networks and can decode signals from different microfluidic channels with ＞90% accuracy through computation even if these signals overlap. As a proof of principle, we use this technology to detect human ovarian cancer cells in four different microfluidic channels fabricated using soft lithography.

Various tools that use a BIM model for automatic quantity take-off as basis for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) have been developed recently. This paper describes the first application of such a BIM-LCA tool to evaluate the embodied global warming potential (GWP) throughout the whole design process of a real building. 34 states of the BIM model are analysed weekly. The results show that the embodied GWP during the design phase is twice as high as for the final building. These changes can be mainly attributed to the designers' approach of using placeholder materials that are refined later, besides other reasons. As such, the embodied GWP is highly overestimated and a BIM-based environmental assessment during the design process could be misleading and counterproductive. Finally, three alternatives to the established automatic quantity take-off are discussed for future developments. • First application of a BIM-LCA approach throughout the design process of a real building • Tracking of design decisions using 34 fixed states of the continuously evolving BIM model • Identification of limitations of the current BIM-LCA approach • Proposals for future effective environmental performance improvement during the design phase [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]","2020-01","2020-12-18 00:00:47","2020-12-18 00:00:47","","N.PAG-N.PAG","","","109","","Automation in Construction","","","","","","","","","","","a9h","","EBSCOhost","","","","","","BUILDING information modeling; Building Information Modelling (BIM); BUILDING performance; Design process; GLOBAL warming; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Performance assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current digital compensation method can reduce the CA by pre‐processing the image contents but at the cost of extra memory space, processing time, and power consumption. Moreover, it is not possible to digitally compensate the CA within each color channel. Here, a practical optical approach is presented to correct the CAs, including the sub‐channel ones, in the virtual reality system, whose functionality is verified by both ray‐tracing analysis and experimental results. In this device, a compact ultra‐broadband Pancharatnam‐Berry phase lens (PBL) with complex axial molecular structure is fabricated and then hybridized with a refractive Fresnel lens. Due to their opposite chromatic dispersion, the system's CA is significantly reduced. To eliminate ghost image from the zero‐order leakage of PBL, a broadband circular polarizer is implemented to block the stray light. As a result, clear image within the entire 100° field‐of‐view is achieved.

On the internet, a huge amount of information competes for our (limited) attention. Moreover, despite the increasing quantity of contents, quality may be poor, making the environment particularly florid for misinformation spreading. In such a context, our cognitive biases emerge, first and foremost, confirmation bias, i.e. the human tendency to look for information that is already in agreement with one's system of beliefs. To shade light on the phenomenon, we present a collection of works investigating how information gets consumed and shapes communities on Facebook. We find that confirmation bias plays a crucial role in content selection and diffusion, and we provide empirical evidence of the existence of echo chambers, i.e. well separated and polarised groups of like‐minded users sharing a same narrative. Immersed in these bubbles, users keep framing and reinforcing their world view, ignoring information dissenting from their preferred narrative. In this scenario, corrections in the form of fact‐checking or debunking attempts seem to fail and have instead a backfire effect.

Food safety professionals play an important role in protecting the public from foodborne illness. A survey of food safety professionals (n = 314) was conducted to characterize their knowledge of NoVs and to identify gaps in this knowledge. To recruit individuals, 25 professional organizations promoted the survey via their Web sites, newsletters, and/or e-mail distribution lists. The survey used true or false and open-ended questions to assess knowledge about NoVs, including attribution, transmission, and prevention and control strategies, including food handling practices. The online survey was available from mid-October 2012 to mid-January 2013. Of the 314 respondents, 66.2% correctly identified NoVs as one of the three most common causes of foodborne disease in the United States. Only 5.4% of respondents correctly identified the three most common settings for NoV infections, and 65.0% of respondents had the misperception that cruise ships are one of the three most common settings. Seventeen respondents (5.4%) answered all 20 true-or-false questions correctly, 33 respondents (10.5%) answered at least 19 of the 20 questions correctly, and 186 respondents (65.0%) answered at least 15 of the 20 questions correctly (i.e., a score of 75% or higher). The content domain in which respondents had the most incorrect answers was food handling practices. Thirty-eight percent of respondents incorrectly responded that it is safe for restaurant workers infected with NoVs to handle packaged food, food equipment, and utensils. About half of respondents did not know the recommended sanitizing solution for eliminating NoVs from a contaminated surface. The survey findings identified several important gaps in food safety professionals' knowledge of NoVs. The study results will inform the development of a Web-based educational module on NoVs to improve efforts to prevent the spread of NoVs in retail and institutional food establishments.

Therefore, exploring the laws of rumor propagation has been one of the hot topics in current researches. Most traditional rumor spreading models are based on infectious disease transmission models, such as SIR. Since the influence of individual differences and the network structure on rumor spreading are not considered, the rumor propagation process in complex networks can only be described in a coarse-grained manner. In this paper, we consider the role of different users in rumor propagation. Based on the degree of different nodes in the network, we design a new state transition function for each node and proposed a new rumor propagation ILSR model. Firstly, we analyze the model, calculate the equilibrium point and the basic reproductive number to prove the rationality of the model. Then experiments are performed in WS networks, BA scale-free networks and a real Facebook network to investigate the relationship between various nodes with time and the impact of network structure on rumor propagation, and the experimental results show the correctness and effectiveness of the model. It provides a reference for exploring the propagation law of rumors in complex networks and guiding and controlling the propagation of rumors. • We establish a differential equation of rumor propagation dynamics. • A new node-state transition function is proposed to describe rumor propagation. • Combining the actual social network, a new rumor propagation model is proposed. • The actual influence of different degrees and network topology is investigated.

Consequently, much of the health-related information and advice available online is inaccurate and/or misleading. Scores of medical institution Web sites are for organizations that do not exist and more than 90% of online pharmacy Web sites are fraudulent. In addition to monetary losses exacted on unsuspecting users, these fake medical Web sites have severe public safety ramifications. According to a World Health Organization report, approximately half the drugs sold on the Web are counterfeit, resulting in thousands of deaths. In this study, we propose an adaptive learning algorithm called recursive trust labeling (RTL). RTL uses underlying content and graph-based classifiers, coupled with a recursive labeling mechanism, for enhanced detection of fake medical Web sites. The proposed method was evaluated on a test bed encompassing nearly 100 million links between 930,000Web sites, including 1,000 known legitimate and fake medical sites. The experimental results revealed that RTL was able to significantly improve fake medical Web site detection performance over 19 comparison content and graph-based methods, various meta-learning techniques, and existing adaptive learning approaches, with an overall accuracy of over 94%. Moreover, RTL was able to attain high performance levels even when the training dataset composed of as little as 30 Web sites. With the increased popularity of eHealth and Health 2.0, the results have important implications for online trust, security, and public safety.

E. Schattschneider's (1975) model of conflict socialization, this study conceptualizes rumor communities, instead of the more typical rumor chains, engaged in a form of social and political activism similar to that of interest groups. It examines online user-generated commentary from the ""vaccines cause autism"" rumor community, a grassroots group that resists government-mandated vaccine requirements. Community members limit the scope of conflict by asserting authority to speak publicly and rejecting contributors with countering opinions as irrelevant. They sustain their threatened community by denying scientific evidence and demanding unattainable levels of scientific proof, and they socialize conflict by recruiting bystanders to enter the fray using appeals to wider social values. Understanding rumors as persuasive appeals that are socially constructed and maintained helps explain the survival of rumors and has implications for official debunking efforts. Schattschneider's theory effectively models the behaviors of non-institutionalized groups but requires adaptation to the modern political communication environment and post-Reagan beliefs about government. Asserting the authority to speak publicly and maintaining group viability are necessary precursors to socializing conflict for grassroots interest groups. When citizens have been taught government is the problem rather than the solution, socializing political conflict may not be synonymous with federalizing it.

Since all modules are connected with the shortest distance, this connection system can reduce wire harness weight by 30%. Forward error correction is done by $N$-x Manchester encoding on the transmitter side and majority voting on the receiver side. High noise immunity is achieved through synchronous receiving by the digital clock recovery circuit which is robust against noise. Communication tests were conducted at 280 Mb/s with 10 transceivers fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology connected by a 10 m unshielded twisted pair cable.

A distinct feature of the minimal fab is its clean-localized system eliminating a need of cleanroom environment. The clean level of the system is estimated by measuring separately each clean-localized component of the system including a minimal shipping case, wafer carrier, wafer load-lock system, and machine process chamber using a particle counter. The clean level of the system is analyzed to be in the ISO class 4, which is in the same class of a super clean room. In order to confirm the cleanliness needed for device fabrications, we employ a lithography system of the minimal fab consisting of a minimal coater, a minimal maskless exposure system using digital light processing technique, and a minimal developer hybridizing with conventional fab equipment to fabricate a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) field-effect-transistors (FET).

Approximately 3500 infants die from SIDS and sleep-related reasons on a yearly basis. Unintentional sleep-related deaths and bed sharing, a known risk factor for SIDS, are on the rise. Furthermore, ethnic disparities exist among those most affected by SIDS. Despite public health campaigns, infant mortality persists. Given the popularity of social media, understanding social media conversations around SIDS and safe sleep may assist the medical and public health communities with information needed to spread, reinforce, or counteract false information regarding SIDS and safe sleep. Objective: The objective of our study was to investigate the social media conversation around SIDS and safe sleep to understand the possible influences and guide health promotion efforts and public health research as well as enable health professionals to engage in directed communication regarding this topic. Methods: We used textual analytics to identify topics and extract meanings contained in unstructured textual data. Twitter messages were captured during September, October, and November in 2017. Tweets and retweets were collected using NUVI software in conjunction with Twitter's search API using the keywords: ""sids,"" ""infant death syndrome,"" ""sudden infant death syndrome,"" and ""safe sleep."" This returned a total of 41,358 messages, which were analyzed using text mining and social media monitoring software. Results: Multiple themes were identified, including recommendations for safe sleep to prevent SIDS, safe sleep devices, the potential causes of SIDS, and how breastfeeding reduces SIDS. Compared with September and November, more personal and specific stories of infant loss were demonstrated in October (Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month). The top influencers were news organizations, universities, and health-related organizations. Conclusions: We identified valuable topics discussed and shared on Twitter regarding SIDS and safe sleep. The study results highlight the contradicting information a subset of the population is exposed to regarding SIDS and the continued controversy over vaccines. In addition, this analysis emphasizes the lack of public health organizations' presence on Twitter compared with the influence of universities and news media organizations. The results also demonstrate the prevalence of safe sleep products that are embedded in safe sleep messaging. These findings can assist providers in speaking about relevant topics when engaging in conversations about the prevention of SIDS and the promotion of safe sleep. Furthermore, public health agencies and advocates should utilize social media and Twitter to better communicate accurate health information as well as continue to combat the spread of false information.

Design: A 2 × 2 × 5 between-subjects Web-based experiment. Parents were randomly shown an advertisement (counter-advertisement challenging FOPP/control advertisement) and then a pair of food products from the same category: an unhealthy product featuring an FOPP (nutrient content claim/sports celebrity endorsement) and a healthier control product with no FOPP. Setting: Australia. Participants: A total ot 1,269 Australian-based parents of children aged 5–12 years recruited from an online panel. Main Outcome Measures: Parents nominated which product they would prefer to buy and which they thought was healthier, then rated the unhealthy product and FOPP on various characteristics. Analysis: Differences between advertisement conditions were assessed using logistic regression (product choice tasks) and analysis of variance tests (ratings of unhealthy product and FOPP). Results. Compared with parents who saw a control advertisement, parents who saw a counter-advertisement perceived unhealthy products featuring FOPPs as less healthy, expressed weaker intentions for buying such products, and were more likely to read the nutrition facts panel before nominating choices (all P < .001). Conclusions and Implications: Counter-advertising may help reduce the misleading influence of unhealthy food marketing and improve the accuracy of parents’ evaluations of how nutritious promoted food products are.

Counteracting myths with facts and evidence has been shown to be effective educational tools to increase an individuals' knowledge about a certain condition and to reduce stigma.The purpose of this study was to identify common obesity myths within the healthcare and public domains and to develop evidence-based counterarguments to diffuse them. An online search of grey literature, media and public health information sources was conducted to identify common obesity myths. A list of 10 obesity myths was developed and reviewed by obesity experts and key opinion leaders. Counterarguments were developed using current research evidence and validated by obesity experts. A survey of obesity experts and health professionals was conducted to determine the usability and potential effectiveness of the myth-fact messages to reduce weight bias. A total of 754 individuals responded to the request to complete the survey. Of those who responded, 464 (61.5%) completed the survey. All 10 obesity myths were identified to be deeply pervasive within Canadian healthcare and public domains.

Students were asked to participate in voluntary screening of health behaviors upon arrival at SHS. One hundred and twenty-three students who used marijuana at least monthly completed assessments and were randomized to one of four intervention conditions in a 2 (intervention: Marijuana eCHECKUP TO GO vs. control)×2 (site of intervention: on-site vs. off-site) between-groups design. Follow-up assessments were conducted online at 3 and 6months. Latent growth modeling was used to provide effect size estimates for the influence of intervention on outcomes. One thousand and eighty undergraduate students completed screening. The intervention did not influence marijuana use frequency. However, there was evidence of a small overall intervention effect on marijuana-related consequences and a medium effect in stratified analyses in the on-site condition. Analyses of psychological variables showed that the intervention significantly reduced perceived norms regarding peer marijuana use. These findings demonstrate that it is feasible to identify marijuana users in SHS and deliver an automated web-based intervention to these students in different contexts. Effect size estimates suggest that the intervention has some promise as a means of correcting misperceptions of marijuana use norms and reducing marijuana-related consequences. Future work should test the efficacy of this intervention in a full scale randomized controlled trial.

Numerous models have been devised to describe this process, including epidemic models and spin models, which mainly focus on how opinions spread and interact with each other, respectively. In this paper, we propose a model that combines the spreading stage and the interaction stage for opinions to illustrate the process of dispelling a rumor. Moreover, we set up authoritative nodes, which disseminate positive opinion to counterbalance the negative opinion prevailing on online social networking sites. With analysis of the relationship among positive opinion proportion, opinion strength and the density of authoritative nodes in networks with different topologies, we demonstrate that the positive opinion proportion grows with the density of authoritative nodes until the positive opinion prevails in the entire network. In particular, the relationship is linear in homogeneous topologies. Besides, it is also noteworthy that initial locations of the negative opinion source and authoritative nodes do not influence positive opinion proportion in homogeneous networks but have a significant impact on heterogeneous networks. The results are verified by numerical simulations and are helpful to understand the mechanism of two different opinions interacting with each other on online social networking sites.

The rise of Twitter as a key venue for political journalists would seem to support their fact-checking activities. Through a content analysis of political journalists' Twitter discourse surrounding the 2012 presidential debates, this study examines the degree to which fact-checking techniques were used on Twitter and the ways in which journalists on Twitter adhered to the practices of either ""professional"" or ""scientific"" objectivity -- the mode that underlies the fact-checking enterprise -- or disregarded objectivity altogether. A typology of tweets indicates that fact checking played a notable but secondary role in journalists' Twitter discourse. Professional objectivity, especially simple stenography, dominated reporting practices on Twitter, and opinion and commentary were also prevalent. We determine that Twitter is indeed conducive to some elements of fact checking. But taken as a whole, our data suggest that journalists and commentators posted opinionated tweets about the candidates' claims more often than they fact checked those claims.

This worrying phenomenon is co-opting more patients away from scientifically tested care strategies. Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information in populations. Working together, MIMOS Berhad, Malaysia's largest Applied Research and Development Centre in Information and Communications Technology, Industrial Electronics Technology and Nano-Semiconductor Technology; and the National Cancer Society of Malaysia aimed to tackle this serious health systems gap in provision of health information to cancer patients, families and the larger public. Aim: The aim of this project was to construct a sentiment analysis tool on cancer and develop an expert-driven support network for utilizing this tool for identifying pseudoscience-related cancer discussions and material in the Malaysian online space; and act to counterbalance these discussions with scientific facts. Strategy/Tactics: First, the tool was evaluated to determine its accuracy in identifying cancer-related pseudoscience news in the Malaysian context. This was done by having content experts objectively ascertain the analysis carried out by the tool. Once consensus had been reached with the experts, the tool was deployed. The support system mechanism consisted of a voluntarily recruited expert panel consisting of healthcare professionals briefed on the mechanism of the tool. Once the tool was deployed, the resultant analysis was shared out to the expert panel who then responded; counterbalancing the pseudoscience material identified in the respective online medium with accurate information. Program/Policy process: The sentiment analysis tool deployed machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing techniques to automate sentiment analysis on large collections of online cancer-related texts, including Web pages, online news, Internet discussion groups, online reviews, Web blogs, and social media. The tool was combined with a support-systems network of healthcare professionals who acted on the analysis results. A weekly run analysis and feedback mechanism was determined to be viable in terms of turn-around-time (TOT) while still remaining 'current' in the fast-paced online scene. Outcomes/What was learned: A marriage of an artificial intelligence system backed by human content experts can be a viable, sustainable mechanism in reducing the impact of pseudoscience in the online cancer ecosphere and help in provisioning accurate health information to cancer patients, families and the general public as a whole.

Consequently, it is important the public knows who to seek for accurate and evidenced-based nutrition information. Limited research exists on the public’s perception of the roles and responsibilities of a registered dietitian (RD). The current study investigated the knowledge and perceptions of college students on the roles of RDs. An online Qualtrics survey was given to 136 students from various universities in the southeast region. Ten questions were used to gauge students’ knowledge and perceptions of RDs compared to other healthcare and non-healthcare individuals. Within-subjects analysis of variance (ANOVA) and planned pairwise comparisons, using Sidak-Bonferroni corrections, revealed that RDs were the most trusted to treat nutritional needs when compared to doctors, nurses, personal trainers, and family and friends (p <0.001), but not when compared to nutritionists. However, students’ perceptions of the functions and roles of RDs only differed when compared to personal trainers and nurses (p <0.001), not when compared to doctors or nutritionists. These findings suggest that college students trust the counsel of an RD, but are unable to distinguish which professional's advice should be sought in certain situations. More research must be conducted to accurately assess the public's knowledge on factors distinguishing RDs, doctors, and nutritionists. Informing the general population about the differences between an RD and healthcare professionals is vital for individuals to receive the most accurate and evidence-based nutritional information from the experts in the field.

The temporal resolution of the conventional pulse-shrinking mechanism is determined by the size ratio between homogeneous and inhomogeneous elements. The proposed scheme which features double-stage operation derives its resolution according to the time difference between pulse-shrinking and pulse-stretching amounts. Thus, it can achieve greater immunity against temperature and ambient variations than that of the single-stage scheme. The circuit area also can be reduced by the proposed pulse-mixing scheme. In addition, this study proposes an improved cyclic delay line to eliminate the undesirable shift in the temporal resolution successfully. Therefore, the effective resolution can be controlled completely by the pulse-mixing unit to improve accuracy. The proposed TDC composed of only one cyclic delay line and one counter is fabricated in a TSMC CMOS 0.35-μm DPQM process. The chip core occupies an extremely small area of 0.02 mm2, which is the best among the related works. The experimental result shows that an effective resolution of around 53 ps within ±13% variation over a 0-100 °C temperature range is achieved. The power consumption is 90 μW at a sample rate of 1000 samples/s. In addition to the reduced area, the proposed TDC circuit achieves its resolution with less thermal-sensitivity and better fluctuations caused by process variations.

In this study, we examined whether providing information that counters these concerns might impact on intentions to use NRT. Participants: 900 smokers recruited from a market research database. Design and setting: Participants completed an online survey that asked about their views about NRT. Smokers with safety and efficacy concerns were queried to determine whether accurate information might increase their interest in using NRT. Findings: Misperceptions of NRT safety were common: 93% of smokers did not know that smoking while wearing the nicotine patch does not cause heart attacks; 76% that nicotine gum/lozenge are not as addictive as cigarettes; and 69% that NRT products are not as dangerous as cigarettes. Over half of the smokers with misperceptions reported that they would be more likely to use NRT to help them quit smoking if they were exposed to information correcting their concerns (53%, 58% and 66%, respectively, for each of the misperceptions). Conclusions: These data suggest that while a sizeable proportion of smokers are still misinformed about the safety of NRT, misinformed smokers would increase consideration of NRT if these misperceptions are addressed by corrective information.

By presenting a case study on the escape and man-hunting of a key terrorist in Southeast Asia, the article examines prosumption and transmediation practices whereby official stories of the terrorist escape are appropriated, remediated, and virally disseminated across different social media–blogs, vlogs, and digital games–to help clarify how new media supports critical citizen engagement.

We analyzed the source, content and accuracy of IBD videos found on YouTube® – one of the most popular websites in the United States – and assessed the demographic variables of the viewers. Methods: The 100 most viewed videos with relevant information on IBD were analyzed. We included only English language videos that were less than 20min in length and primarily focused on IBD. Those with no sound/poor sound quality were excluded. More than 30 variables were analyzed. Results: Adults of 45–54years old (95.1%) comprised the most common age group of viewers. Forty-eight percent of videos focused on Crohn''s disease (CD), 32.0% on ulcerative colitis (UC), and 20.0% on both. Overall content for patient education was poor. Videos discussing alternative treatment options were more likely to depict patients'' personal experience (73.9% vs. 2.4%) (p<0.001) and be an advertisement compared to patient education videos (78.3% vs. 0) (p<0.001).

Speed and function density of FPGAs are increasing as transistor sizes shrink to the nanoscale. As these transistors reduce in size intrinsic variability becomes more of a problem and to reliably create electronic designs according to specification time consuming statistical simulations become necessary; and even with accurate models and statistical simulation, the fabrication yield will decrease as every physical instance of a design behaves differently. This paper describes an adaptive, evolvable architecture that allows for correction and optimization of circuits directly in hardware using bioinspired techniques. Similar to FPGAs, the programmable analog and digital array (PAnDA) architecture introduced provides a digital configuration layer for circuit design. Accessing additional configuration options of the underlying analog layer enables continuous adjustment of circuit characteristics at runtime, which enables dynamic optimization of the mapped design's performance. Moreover, the yield of devices can be improved postfabrication via reconfiguration of the analog layer, which can overcome faults induced due to variability and process defects. Since optimization goals are generic, i.e., not restricted to reducing stochastic variability, power consumption or increasing speed, the same mechanisms can also enhance the device's fault tolerant abilities in the case of component degradation and failures during its lifetime or when exposed to hazardous environments.

The method relies on using a parameterized behavioral model implemented on FPGA, whose parameters values are adaptively tuned, based on the response to test pseudo-random actuation of the physical structure. Dedicated comb drives actuate the movable mass with binary maximum length pseudo- random sequences of small amplitude, to keep the device within the linear operating regime. The frequency of the stimulus is chosen within the mechanical spectral operating range of the micro-device, such that the induced response leads to the identification of the mechanical transfer function, and to the tuning of the associated digital behavioral model. In case of a micro-gyroscope, experimental results demonstrate the adaptive tracking of the damping coefficient from 5.57 × 10  Kg/ s to 7.12 × 10  Kg/ s and of the stiffness coefficient from 132  N/ m to 137.7  N/ m. In the case of a MEMS accelerometer, the damping and stiffness coefficients are correctly tracked from 3.4 × 10  Kg/ s and 49.56  N/ m to 4.57 × 10  Kg/ s and 51.48  N/ m, respectively-the former values are designer-specified target values, while the latter are experimentally measured parameters for fabricated devices operating in a real environment. Hardware resources estimation confirms the small area the proposed algorithm occupies on the targeted FPGA device.

The mixing and segregation phenomenon occur in most systems of granular solids and have a significant influence on the quality and outcome of the final product. The usual approach to mix the powders is by using a tumbling blender which rotates around one axis, where, the radial convection is reported to be faster than axial dispersion transport, hindering the mixing performance. A double cone mixer is fabricated which rotates around two axes, causing axial mixing competitive to its radial counterpart. Samples are collected intrusively using the discrete pocket samplers to quantify the characteristics of mixing for millimeter sized glass beads. Digital video recording and MATLAB based image analysis techniques are used for non-intrusive characterization of mixing in micron sized art sands. A parametric study of the effect of particle size, vessel speeds on the granular mixing is accomplished. Incorporation of dual axis rotation enhances axial mixing by 70–90% in comparison to single axis rotation. Particles of smaller sizes (art sand) tend to mix quicker than the bigger particles (glass beads) due to mild cohesive effects.

Moreover, features represented by probes that either have similar molecular functions (gene expression analysis) or genomic locations (DNA copy number analysis) are highly correlated. Classical model selection methods such as penalized logistic regression or random forest become unstable in the presence of high feature correlations. Sophisticated penalties such as group Lasso or fused Lasso can force the models to assign similar weights to correlated features and thus improve model stability and interpretability. In this article, we show that the measures of feature relevance corresponding to the above-mentioned methods are biased such that the weights of the features belonging to groups of correlated features decrease as the sizes of the groups increase, which leads to incorrect model interpretation and misleading feature ranking.Results: With simulation experiments, we demonstrate that Lasso logistic regression, fused support vector machine, group Lasso and random forest models suffer from correlation bias. Using simulations, we show that two related methods for group selection based on feature clustering can be used for correcting the correlation bias. These techniques also improve the stability and the accuracy of the baseline models. We apply all methods investigated to a breast cancer and a bladder cancer arrayCGH dataset and in order to identify copy number aberrations predictive of tumor phenotype.Availability: R code can be found at: http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~laura/Clustering.r.Contact: laura.tolosi@mpi-inf.mpg.deSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Since the imaging detectors are fabricated by semiconductor manufacturing process over large areas, defective pixels in the detectors are unavoidable. Moreover, the radiation damage due to the routine use of the detectors progressively increases the density of defective pixels. In this study, we present a method of identifying defective pixels in digital radiography detectors based on wavelet analysis. Artifacts generated due to wavelet transformations have been prevented by an additional local threshold method. The proposed method was applied to a sample digital radiography and the result was promising. The proposed method uses a single pair of dark and white images and does not require them to be corrected in gain-and-offset properties. This method will be helpful for the reliable use of digital radiography detectors through the working lifetime.

Techniques based on the direct observation of the pore system (optical and scanning electron microscopes, digital image analysis) were combined with others used for indirect characterization (mercury intrusion porosimetry, N2 adsorption, hydric tests, and vapour permeability). In addition, we performed accelerated decay tests to determine the durability of the stones and to check the consistency of the results obtained in the pore system study. Digital image analysis allowed us to calculate the pore size distribution and the total porosity. Digital image analysis always gave higher values for total porosity than those determined by porosimetry and hydric tests, which only measure open porosity. The density values were congruent with the mineralogy of the stones. The stone that obtained the best results in the various tests in terms of its petrophysical parameters was dolostone, while the worst performance was by one of the two limestones. These results were confirmed by the decay tests. The combined use of these different techniques gave us an accurate interpretation of the pore systems of the six different stones, and also enabled us to correct misleading interpretations caused by the limitations of using one single technique. Our findings also provide useful information to help prevent the decay of these stones.

This study examined Finnish citizens’ opinions about authorities as crisis managers during the swine flu epidemic of 2009–2010 and examined the success of authority intervention to online discussion forums. Through a content analysis carried out at the discussion forums, the study showed that though authorities are highly trusted in general in Finland, this trust is not extended to the online environment. Online, civilians did not trust authorities and the protective actions taken. Moreover, the authorities’ intervention to the discussion forums aimed at correcting false information and shaping opinions seemed to fail, as the intervention was carried out too late and with too little resources.

These ongoing enhancements permit increasingly detailed comparisons between the simulation outputs and real observational data. Recent projects such as Illustris are capable of producing simulated images that are designed to be comparable to those obtained from local surveys. This paper tests the degree to which Illustris achieves this goal across a diverse population of galaxies using visual morphologies derived from Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists. Morphological classifications provided by these volunteers for simulated galaxies are compared with similar data for a compatible sample of images drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Legacy Survey. This paper investigates how simple morphological characterization by human volunteers asked to distinguish smooth from featured systems differs between simulated and real galaxy images. Significant differences are identified, which are most likely due to the limited resolution of the simulation, but which could be revealing real differences in the dynamical evolution of populations of galaxies in the real and model universes. Specifically, for stellar masses , a substantially larger proportion of Illustris galaxies that exhibit disk-like morphology or visible substructure, relative to their SDSS counterparts. Toward higher masses, the visual morphologies for simulated and observed galaxies converge and exhibit similar distributions. The stellar mass threshold indicated by this divergent behavior confirms recent works using parametric measures of morphology from Illustris simulated images. When , the Illustris data set contains substantially fewer galaxies that classifiers regard as unambiguously featured. In combination, these results suggest that comparison between the detailed properties of observed and simulated galaxies, even when limited to reasonably massive systems, may be misleading.

This work represents the first demonstration of a large-area, flexible, paper-based graphene-molybdenum disulfide (Gr/MoS2) broadband photodetector using a low-cost solution-processed hydrothermal method and enhancement in photodetection through strain modulation by assembling the device on polydimethylsiloxane. Optimization, in terms of process parameters, was carried out to obtain trilayer MoS2 over Gr-cellulose paper. Under strain, potential barrier variation and piezopotential induced in MoS2 leads to 79.41% enhancement in photodetection in the visible region. Piezopotential induced in MoS2 lowers the conduction-band energy thereby increasing the effective electric field favoring easy electron-hole separation. The advantage of vertically stacked Gr/MoS2 for the photodetector is the utilization of the entire area as a junction where effective separation of electron-hole pairs occurs. Detailed studies of the mechanism in terms of potential barrier variation in Gr/MoS2 and an energy-band diagram are presented to help understand the proposed phenomenon. The present work demonstrates the significance of few-layer MoS2 or Gr in relation to strain-modulated photosensing in comparison to their counterparts grown via chemical vapor deposition. The results provide an excellent approach for the fabrication of low-cost heterojunctions for improved optoelectronic performance, which can be further extended to similar 2D-material heterojunctions for analog, digital and optoelectronic applications.

Adequate dissemination of correct information about H1N1 influenza could help in decreasing the disease spread and associated anxiety in the population. Purpose: This study aims to examine the effective use of the popular Internet video site YouTube as an information source during the initial phase of the H1N1 outbreak. Methods: YouTube was searched on June 26, 2009, using the keywords swine flu, H1N1 influenza, and influenza for videos uploaded in the past 3 months containing relevant information about the disease. The videos were classified as useful, misleading, or as news updates based on the kind of information contained. Total viewership, number of days since upload, total duration of videos, and source of upload were noted. Results: A total of 142 videos had relevant information about H1N1 influenza. In all, 61.3% of videos had useful information about the disease, whereas 23% were misleading. Total viewership share of useful videos was 70.5%, whereas that of misleading videos was 17.5%, with no significant difference in viewership/day. The CDC contributed about 12% of the useful videos, with a significant viewership share of 47%. No significant differences were seen in viewership/day for useful videos based on the kind of information they contained. Conclusions: YouTube has a substantial amount of useful information about H1N1 influenza. A source-based preference is seen among the viewers, and CDC-uploaded videos are being used in an increasing proportion as a source of authentic information about the disease.

SCD routinely manufactures both analog and digital InSb FPAs with array formats of 320×256, 480×384, and 640×512 elements, and pitch size in the range 15 to 30 m. These FPAs are available in many packaging configurations, including fully integrated detector-Dewarcooler-assembly, with either closed-cycle Stirling or open-loop Joule-Thomson coolers. In response to a need for very high resolution midwave IR (MWIR) detectors and systems, SCD has developed a large format 2D InSb detector with 1280×1024 elements and pixel size of 15 m. The ROIC is fabricated in CMOS 0.18-µm technology, that enables the small pixel circuitry and relatively low power generation at the focal plane. The digital ROIC has an analog to digital (A/D) converter per-channel and allows for full frame readout at a rate of 100 Hz. Such on-chip A/D conversion eliminates the need for several A/D converters with fairly high power consumption at the system level. The digital readout, together with the InSb detector technology, lead to a wide linear dynamic range and low residual nonuniformity, which is stable over a long period of time following a nonuniformity correction procedure. A special Dewar was designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions while minimizing the contribution to the heat load of the detector. The Dewar together with the low power ROIC, enable a megapixel detector with overall low size, weight, and power with respect to comparable large format detectors. A variety of applications with this detector make use of different cold shields with different f-number and spectral filters. In this paper we present actual performance characteristics of the megapixel InSb detector and demonstrate its high manufacturability.

Or they can take a chance with an online novelty-card site. Yet the most popular way of pretending to be 21 remains decidedly low tech: using identification that belongs to older friends or siblings. In a study of some 1,100 under-age students by University of Missouri researchers, published this month in the journal Addictive Behaviors, 69 percent with fake IDs said friends or relatives had given them one. Dennis Deters, a lawyer who defends Miami University of Ohio students facing fake-ID charges, explains how it works: ''You can just go into the bureau of motor vehicles and say, 'I lost my license,' and then you give it to your buddy. You have a real ID opposed to something fabricated.'' That's useful because of harder-to-counterfeit features like raised lettering, microprinting and ghost images.
