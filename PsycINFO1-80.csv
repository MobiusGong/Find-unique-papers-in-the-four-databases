Pandemics and psas: Rapidly changing information in a new media landscape,"ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic has brought into focus a shift in the communication of health-related information. Traditionally, public service announcements (PSAs) consisted of video or radio messages, posters, or billboards created by government agencies and health organizations to provide information about health topics. However, the widespread use of the internet and the growth of social media has changed PSA creation and dissemination in many ways. Increasingly, a variety of actors, including non-official sources and lay persons, have been using social media to disseminate PSAs or PSA-like content. Audiences are larger and more engaged with content, and users have the novel ability to interact with PSAs through shares, likes, or comments. While social media for health communication has many advantages, there are also a number of disadvantages including misinformation, conspiracy theories, bots, and trolls. Credibility of different sources has also become a topic of debate. An ongoing challenge during the pandemic has been reaching audiences in a crowded online environment, establishing authority as a trusted source, and countering misinformation. In this paper, we discuss how the media landscape is changing PSAs and the implications of these changes in the context of pandemics.

Feeling angry: The effects of vaccine misinformation and refutational messages on negative emotions and vaccination attitude,"Vaccine misinformation circulated on social media has negatively impacted people’s vaccine beliefs and behaviors. Communication strategies to address misinformation including fact-checking and warning labels have shown conflicting effects. This study examined how short-term exposure to vaccine misinformation impacted vaccination attitude through both cognitive and affective routes and tested whether and how two-sided refutational messages could negate the misinformation’s impact. We conducted an online experiment involving a convenient sample of 609 U.S. adult participants with five message conditions: two misinformation messages (one using the conspiracy frame and one using the uncertainty frame), two corresponding two-sided refutational messages, and a control group. Results showed that both conspiracy and uncertainty framed misinformation messages decreased pro-vaccination attitude in comparison to the control. The two refutational messages increased pro-vaccination attitude in comparison to the corresponding misinformation messages. These effects were further mediated by the emotion of anger. Parental status and conspiracy beliefs did not moderate effects of the messages on vaccination attitude. Our findings indicate two-sided refutational messages can be a promising strategy to combat vaccine misinformation.

The battle is on: Factors that motivate people to combat anti-vaccine misinformation,"ABSTRACT This study proposes a theory-driven model to concurrently examine the cognitive and emotional factors that motivate vaccine supporters to combat erroneous online anti-vaccination information. The model was tested using data from a web survey of 599 vaccination supporters in the United States. The vaccine supporters reported greater support for government regulation of misinformation when they perceived greater susceptibility among the general public to the influence of misinformation. Surprisingly, the perceived severity of the influence was inversely related to respondents’ intention to correct misinformation. In addition, perceived susceptibility to the influence of anti-vaccine misinformation and perceived severity of its influence on others induced negative emotions that included anticipated guilt and anger. The negative emotions in turn motivate vaccine supporters to attitudinally support government’s media restriction or behaviorally correct the online misinformation.

Identifying factors that conjointly influence nicotine vaping product relative harm perception among smokers and recent ex-smokers: Findings from the 2016 itc four country smoking and vaping survey,"BACKGROUND: Use of nicotine vaping products (NVPs) to replace smoking is often influenced by perceived harmfulness of these products relative to smoking. This study aimed to identify factors that conjointly influenced NVP relative harm perception among smokers and ex-smokers. METHODS: Data (n = 11,838) from adult smokers and ex-smokers (quit &lt; 2 years) who participated in the 2016 ITC 4 Country Smoking and Vaping Surveys in Australia, Canada, England and the US were analyzed. Decision tree models were used to classify respondents into those who perceived vaping as less harmful than smoking (“correct” perception) versus otherwise (“incorrect” perception) based on their socio-demographic, smoking and vaping related variables. RESULTS: Decision tree analysis identified nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) harmfulness perceptions relative to smoking, perceived vaping portrayal in the media and other sources as positive, negative or balanced, recency of seeking online vaping information, and age as the key variables that interacted conjointly to classify respondents into those with “correct” versus “incorrect” harm perceptions of vaping relative to smoking (model performance accuracy = 0.70–0.74). In all countries, NRT relative harmfulness perception and vaping portrayal perception were consistently the two most important classifying variables, with other variables showing some country differences. CONCLUSIONS: In all four countries, perception of NVP relative harmfulness among smokers and recent ex-smokers is strongly influenced by a combination of NRT relative harmfulness perception and vaping portrayal in the media and other sources. These conjoint factors can serve as useful markers for identifying subgroups more vulnerable to misperception about NVP relative harmfulness to benefit from corrective intervention.

The synchronization of collective beliefs: From dyadic interactions to network convergence,"Systems of beliefs organized around religion, politics, and health constitute the building blocks of human communities. One central feature of these collectively held beliefs is their dynamic nature. Here, we study the dynamics of belief endorsement in lab-created 12-member networks using a 2-phase communication model. Individuals first evaluate the believability of a set of beliefs, after which, in Phase 1, some networks listen to a public speaker mentioning a subset of the previously evaluated beliefs while other networks complete a distracter task. In Phase 2, all participants engage in conversations within their network to discuss the initially evaluated beliefs. Believability is then measured both post conversation and after one week. We find that the public speaker impacts the community’s beliefs by altering their mnemonic accessibility. This influence is long-lasting and amplified by subsequent conversations, resulting in community-wide belief synchronization. These findings point to optimal sociocognitive strategies for combating misinformation in social networks.

Evaluating the impact of attempts to correct health misinformation on social media: A meta-analysis,"ABSTRACT Social media poses a threat to public health by facilitating the spread of misinformation. At the same time, however, social media offers a promising avenue to stem the distribution of false claims – as evidenced by real-time corrections, crowdsourced fact-checking, and algorithmic tagging. Despite the growing attempts to correct misinformation on social media, there is still considerable ambiguity regarding the ability to effectively ameliorate the negative impact of false messages. To address this gap, the current study uses a meta-analysis to evaluate the relative impact of social media interventions designed to correct health-related misinformation (k = 24; N = 6,086). Additionally, the meta-analysis introduces theory-driven moderators that help delineate the effectiveness of social media interventions. The mean effect size of attempts to correct misinformation on social media was positive and significant (d = 0.40, 95% CI [0.25, 0.55], p =.0005) and a publication bias could not be excluded. Interventions were more effective in cases where participants were involved with the health topic, as well as when misinformation was distributed by news organizations (vs. peers) and debunked by experts (vs. non-experts). The findings of this meta-analysis can be used not only to depict the current state of the literature but also to prescribe specific recommendations to better address the proliferation of health misinformation on social media.

Digital disinformation about covid-19 and the third-person effect: Examining the channel differences and negative emotional outcomes,"Expanding third-person effect (TPE) research to digital disinformation, this article investigates the impact of COVID-19 digital fake news exposure on individuals' perceived susceptibility of influence on themselves, their close others, and their distant others. Findings from a survey of 511 Chinese respondents suggest that, overall, individuals would perceive themselves to be less vulnerable than close others and distant others to the impact of COVID-19 digital disinformation. The highest self-other perceptual discrepancy is found when individuals receive disinformation on mobile social networking apps. Also, individuals who practice more active fact-checking perceive themselves to be less susceptible. The perception of disinformation effects on self as well as the self-other perceptual discrepancy is both positively related to emotional responses (anxiety, fear, and worry) to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study contributes to existing research by linking exposure to disinformation in different digital channels, the TPEs, and emotional outcomes in the context of a public health crisis. It also highlights the importance of educating and enabling fact-checking behaviors on digital media, which could help to reduce negative emotional impact of the disinformation.

An eye tracking approach to understanding misinformation and correction strategies on social media: The mediating role of attention and credibility to reduce hpv vaccine misperceptions,"ABSTRACT This study uses an unobtrusive eye tracking approach to examine understudied psychological mechanisms – message attention and credibility – when people are exposed to misinformation and correction on social media. We contrast humor versus non-humor correction strategies that point out rhetorical flaws in misinformation regarding the HPV vaccine, which was selected for its relevance and impact on public health. We randomly assigned participants to one of two experimental conditions: humor correction versus non-humor correction. Our analyses revealed that the humor correction increased attention to the image portion of the correction tweet, and this attention indirectly lowered HPV misperceptions by reducing the credibility of the misinformation tweet. The study also found that the non-humor correction outperformed the humor correction in reducing misperceptions via its higher credibility ratings. Practical implications for correcting misinformation on social media are discussed.

How to fight an infodemic: The four pillars of infodemic management,"In this issue of the Journal of Medical Internet Research, the World Health Organization (WHO) is presenting a framework for managing the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infodemic. Infodemiology is now acknowledged by public health organizations and the WHO as an important emerging scientific field and critical area of practice during a pandemic. From the perspective of being the first “infodemiologist” who originally coined the term almost two decades ago, I am positing four pillars of infodemic management: (1) information monitoring (infoveillance); (2) building eHealth Literacy and science literacy capacity; (3) encouraging knowledge refinement and quality improvement processes such as fact checking and peer-review; and (4) accurate and timely knowledge translation, minimizing distorting factors such as political or commercial influences. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, the United Nations has advocated that facts and science should be promoted and that these constitute the antidote to the current infodemic. This is in stark contrast to the realities of infodemic mismanagement and misguided upstream filtering, where social media platforms such as Twitter have advertising policies that sideline science organizations and science publishers, treating peer-reviewed science as “inappropriate content.” (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)",2428578925, 2020-50570-001,Scholarly Journals,"Eysenbach, Gunther",," © Gunther Eysenbach.

A framework towards computational narrative analysis on blogs/social media,"Social media is widely used to express views and share opinions with others. With the availability of inexpensive and ubiquitous mass communication tools like social media, creating narratives, false information and propaganda is both convenient and effective. Social media users leverage this platform to further their views by framing narratives and participating in online discourse. Almost all events, issues, crises are discussed on social media. Blogs are a good source of data for sociologists and political scientists to gain situational awareness by tracking different opinions, political views, and narratives being shaped. Blogs, unlike other social media platforms, are not regulated by any authority and have no restriction on character limit, provide bloggers with not only space for richer content but also serve as a platform for agenda-setting and content framing abetting development of narratives. Fundamentally, narratives are described with actors and their actions in a given discourse. We propose a novel framework that computationally identifies actors/actions with the help of NLP techniques that include - POS tagging, chunking to obtain noun/verb phrases, and define grammar rules that captures phrases of noun/verb, and finally filter phrases/sentences based on TF-IDF to generate narratives. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed model, we validate the narratives generated with the human annotated narratives. The results for the representative sample of the data indicate the accuracy of our framework as 66.8%. Further, we apply the same model to topic streams and identify narratives within each topic. For a given blog post, our model generates dominant narrative first and then less dominant ones in the decreasing order of their rank. Our proposed framework can help social scientists identify narratives computationally eliminating human effort reasonably. This enables the analysts to learn what resonates with the community and if those interests and views are changing with time under the influence of exogenous factors or events. The results from this study could also be used to build counter narrative measures against propaganda campaigns.

"Correcting fear-arousing disinformation on social media in the spread of a health virus: A focus on situational fear, situational threat appraisal, belief in disinformation, and intention to spread disinformation on social media","Disinformation is prevalent in the current social media environment and circulated just as quickly as truthful information. Research has investigated what motivates the spread of disinformation and how to combat it. However, limited research focuses on how fear-arousing disinformation during crises affects individuals' belief in disinformation and to what extent corrective information can subdue the persuasive effects of fear-arousing disinformation. To address this gap, this research tests the effects of fear-arousing disinformation and different types of corrective information (i.e., no corrective information, simple corrective information, or narrative corrective information) on belief in disinformation and intentions to spread disinformation on social media, during a crisis—the spread of an unknown health virus. Furthermore, adapting the important roles of situational fear and threat appraisal in predicting people's health behavioral changes, this research examines the underlying psychological mechanisms of fear and threat appraisal of a crisis in the effects of fear-arousing disinformation and different types of corrective information on belief in disinformation and intentions to spread disinformation on social media. Study 1 tests the interaction between fear-arousing disinformation and the presence of corrective information. Therefore, a 2 by 2 experiment was conducted in Study 1: disinformation (fear-neutral disinformation vs. fear-arousing disinformation) × corrective information (no corrective information vs. simple corrective information). Study 2 advances Study 1 by testing whether narrative corrective information decreases belief in disinformation. Study 2 conducted a 2 by 2 experiment (disinformation: fear-neutral disinformation vs. fear-arousing disinformation × corrective information: simple corrective information vs. narrative corrective information). A total of 419 data collected between January and February 2019 from Amazon MTurk were analyzed (205 for Study 1 and 214 for Study 2). The current research notes several key findings: 1) Fear-arousing disinformation does not make people believe the disinformation under risky situations and it can even make people avoid the disinformation content as a coping strategy when there is no corrective information presented. 2) Simple corrective information serves as an effective corrective information strategy when fear-neutral disinformation is shown but can backfire when fear-arousing disinformation is presented. 3) Corrective information that features individual narratives does not differ from simple alerts on their abilities to reduce misperceptions, situational fear, situational threat appraisal, and intentions to spread disinformation on social media. 4) Across individual differences, social media usage (i.e., social media use for news, social media use for fact-finding, and social media use for social interaction, health blog usage) emerges as significant factors that decide disinformation and corrective information processing. By testing effects of disinformation in terms of fear-arousal, which reflects a crisis of the spread of a health virus, this research addressed how fear-arousing disinformation and different forms of corrective information affect beliefs in disinformation and willingness to spread disinformation on social media, and how situational fear and situational threat appraisal may play their roles in the belief in disinformation mechanism.

Increasing students' and new professionals' knowledge of child sexual abuse outcomes: an evaluation of an online intervention,"Following disclosure, support from professionals (e.g., mental health clinicians, social workers, health care providers, teachers) can help increase resiliency in youth who experience child sexual abuse (CSA). Particularly, those who respond compassionately and competently, believe and report the abuse, do not blame the victim, and increase the family's protective factors are best suited to decrease negative outcomes. Yet, research shows that many professionals are not adequately prepared to support families due to insufficient knowledge and misinformed beliefs (Pelisoli, Herman, &amp; Dell'Aglio, 2015). Moreover, few assessments measure knowledge specific to the aftermath of CSA and few interventions aim to increase professional knowledge on outcomes with the goal of increasing child resiliency. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to (a) develop and evaluate a measure to assess knowledge and beliefs about the consequences of CSA and (b) develop and evaluate an online intervention that provides students and developing professionals with information about CSA outcomes, corrects misperceptions, and empowers adults to increase child resiliency. Two studies were completed to meet these aims.Findings from Study 1 confirmed that a sample of 143 university students and developing professionals lacked sufficient knowledge about CSA outcomes. The instrument created was determined to be suitable at measuring CSA knowledge and beliefs. The 408 participants in Study 2 first completed the pre-treatment measure of CSA knowledge, were randomly assigned to the online CSA intervention or the attention control group (training on youth development), then completed the post-treatment measure. A subset of the sample completed the CSA assessment again two weeks after initial participation to measure retention.Findings showed that the CSA webinar significantly increased participants' knowledge of CSA outcomes and changed unsupportive beliefs. The control group demonstrated a nominal, yet significant, increase from pre- to post-test. Those who received the CSA training held more knowledge and supportive beliefs than those in the control group and this knowledge was broadly retained two weeks after completion of the training. Participants reported the CSA intervention was valuable and increased their motivation to support survivors. While several CSA-related interventions exist for adults, this intervention addressed gaps in current training efforts.

Where ‘fake news’ flourishes: A comparison across four Western democracies,"How does the content of so-called ‘fake news’ differ across Western democracies? While previous research on online disinformation has focused on the individual level, the current study aims to shed light on cross-national differences. It compares online disinformation re-published by fact checkers from four Western democracies (the US, the UK, Germany, and Austria). The findings reveal significant differences between English-speaking and German-speaking countries. In the US and the UK, the largest shares of partisan disinformation are found, while in Germany and Austria sensationalist stories prevail. Moreover, in English-speaking countries, disinformation frequently attacks political actors, whereas in German-speaking countries, immigrants are most frequently targeted. Across all of the countries, topics of false stories strongly mirror national news agendas. Based on these results, the paper argues that online disinformation is not only a technology-driven phenomenon but also shaped by national information environments.

Systematic literature review on the spread of health-related misinformation on social media,"Contemporary commentators describe the current period as “an era of fake news” in which misinformation, generated intentionally or unintentionally, spreads rapidly. Although affecting all areas of life, it poses particular problems in the health arena, where it can delay or prevent effective care, in some cases threatening the lives of individuals. While examples of the rapid spread of misinformation date back to the earliest days of scientific medicine, the internet, by allowing instantaneous communication and powerful amplification has brought about a quantum change. In democracies where ideas compete in the marketplace for attention, accurate scientific information, which may be difficult to comprehend and even dull, is easily crowded out by sensationalized news. In order to uncover the current evidence and better understand the mechanism of misinformation spread, we report a systematic review of the nature and potential drivers of health-related misinformation. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus and Google databases to identify relevant methodological and empirical articles published between 2012 and 2018. A total of 57 articles were included for full-text analysis. Overall, we observe an increasing trend in published articles on health-related misinformation and the role of social media in its propagation. The most extensively studied topics involving misinformation relate to vaccination, Ebola and Zika Virus, although others, such as nutrition, cancer, fluoridation of water and smoking also featured. Studies adopted theoretical frameworks from psychology and network science, while co-citation analysis revealed potential for greater collaboration across fields. Most studies employed content analysis, social network analysis or experiments, drawing on disparate disciplinary paradigms. Future research should examine susceptibility of different sociodemographic groups to misinformation and understand the role of belief systems on the intention to spread misinformation. Further interdisciplinary research is also warranted to identify effective and tailored interventions to counter the spread of health-related misinformation online.

Comparing the use of open and closed questions for Web-based measures of the continued-influence effect,"Open-ended questions, in which participants write or type their responses, are used in many areas of the behavioral sciences. Although effective in the lab, they are relatively untested in online experiments, and the quality of responses is largely unexplored. Closed-ended questions are easier to use online because they generally require only single key- or mouse-press responses and are less cognitively demanding, but they can bias the responses. We compared the data quality obtained using open and closed response formats using the continued-influence effect (CIE), in which participants read a series of statements about an unfolding event, one of which is unambiguously corrected later. Participants typically continue to refer to the corrected misinformation when making inferential statements about the event. We implemented this basic procedure online (Exp. 1A, n = 78), comparing standard open-ended responses to an alternative procedure using closed-ended responses (Exp. 1B, n = 75). Finally, we replicated these findings in a larger preregistered study (Exps. 2A and 2B, n = 323). We observed the CIE in all conditions: Participants continued to refer to the misinformation following a correction, and their references to the target misinformation were broadly similar in number across open- and closed-ended questions. We found that participants’ open-ended responses were relatively detailed (including an average of 75 characters for inference questions), and almost all responses attempted to address the question. The responses were faster, however, for closed-ended questions. Overall, we suggest that with caution it may be possible to use either method for gathering CIE data.

Digital trespass: Ethical and terms-of-use violations by researchers accessing data from an online patient community,"With the expansion and popularity of research on websites such as Facebook and Twitter, there has been increasing concern about investigator conduct and social media ethics. The availability of large data sets has attracted researchers who are not traditionally associated with health data and its associated ethical considerations, such as computer and data scientists. Reliance on oversight by ethics review boards is inadequate and, due to the public availability of social media data, there is often confusion between public and private spaces. In addition, social media participants and researchers may pay little attention to traditional terms of use. In this paper, we review four cases involving ethical and terms-of-use violations by researchers seeking to conduct social media studies in an online patient research network. These violations involved unauthorized scraping of social media data, entry of false information, misrepresentation of researcher identities of participants on forums, lack of ethical approval and informed consent, use of member quotations, and presentation of findings at conferences and in journals without verifying accurate potential biases and limitations of the data. The correction of these ethical lapses often involves much effort in detecting and responding to violators, addressing these lapses with members of an online community, and correcting inaccuracies in the literature (including retraction of publications and conference presentations). Despite these corrective actions, we do not regard these episodes solely as violations. Instead, they represent broader ethical issues that may arise from potential sources of confusion, misinformation, inadequacies in applying traditional informed consent procedures to social media research, and differences in ethics training and scientific methodology across research disciplines. Social media research stakeholders need to assure participants that their studies will not compromise anonymity or lead to harmful outcomes while preserving the societal value of their health-related studies. Based on our experience and published recommendations by social media researchers, we offer potential directions for future prevention-oriented measures that can be applied by data producers, computer/data scientists, institutional review boards, research ethics committees, and publishers.

Seeking formula for misinformation treatment in public health crises: The effects of corrective information type and source,"An increasing lack of information truthfulness has become a fundamental challenge to communications. Insights into how to debunk this type of misinformation can especially be crucial for public health crises. To identify corrective information strategies that increase awareness and trigger actions during infectious disease outbreaks, an online experiment (N = 700) was conducted, using a U.S. sample. After initial misinformation exposure, participants’ exposure to corrective information type (simple rebuttal vs. factual elaboration) and source (government health agency vs. news media vs. social peer) was varied, including a control group without corrective information. Results show that, if corrective information is present rather than absent, incorrect beliefs based on misinformation are debunked and the exposure to factual elaboration, compared to simple rebuttal, stimulates intentions to take protective actions. Moreover, government agency and news media sources are found to be more successful in improving belief accuracy compared to social peers. The observed mediating role of crisis emotions reveals the mechanism underlying the effects of corrective information. The findings contribute to misinformation research by providing a formula for correcting the increasing spread of misinformation in times of crisis.

"Contraception and the media: Lessons past, present and future","The rise in social media and the pressure on conventional media to garner online hits has the potential to distort the quality of health information available to the consumer. It should be possible to learn from the ‘scares’ of the past to develop strategies to counter the effects of misinformation and scaremongering so commonly seen in any discussion of contraceptive risks. That balanced, evidence-based information is available to all couples considering their contraceptive options should be a priority for all clinicians, academics and journalists working in this area.

Exploring the meaning of pro-vaccine activism across two countries,"While vaccine-critical activism has been widely documented and discussed, comparatively little has been said about the concerted response of pro-vaccine activists defending the majority view. This paper explores two case studies of pro-vaccine activism in Australia and the United States (US). It shows how pro-vaccine views and behaviours can take varying forms due to different aims and methods of engagement—oppositional counteractivities in favour of vaccination in Australia, and issue-based advocacy as part of a political alliance in the US. The focus in Australia comes from a pro-science stance and includes ‘skeptics’ against pseudoscience directly opposing vaccine-critical groups. In the US, the focus takes the form of an issue-specific campaign that has arisen from existing pro-vaccine parent blogs and discussion groups pushing for policy change rather than public confrontation. These case studies exemplify how pro-vaccine activism can take varying forms of either reinforcing the mainstream view or countering digression from it. Drawing on qualitative research, this paper aims to examine the types of practices and strategies employed by activists to voice their support of vaccination, and discusses the means, messages, and motivations of pro-vaccine activism. It ends with an argument for why a study—of public support for in addition to studying public opposition to vaccination—can help to better understand vaccination views and behaviours. These findings have wider implications for the study of counter-activism and the polarisation of civil society groups.

Evaluation of a template for countering misinformation—Real-world autism treatment myth debunking,"Misinformation poses significant challenges to evidence-based practice. In the public health domain specifically, treatment misinformation can lead to opportunity costs or direct harm. Alas, attempts to debunk misinformation have proven sub-optimal, and have even been shown to “backfire”, including increasing misperceptions. Thus, optimized debunking strategies have been developed to more effectively combat misinformation. The aim of this study was to test these strategies in a real-world setting, targeting misinformation about autism interventions. In the context of professional development training, we randomly assigned participants to an “optimized-debunking” or a “treatment-as-usual” training condition and compared support for non-empirically-supported treatments before, after, and six weeks following completion of online training. Results demonstrated greater benefits of optimized debunking immediately after training; thus, the implemented strategies can serve as a general and flexible debunking template. However, the effect was not sustained at follow-up, highlighting the need for further research into strategies for sustained change.

"Regulating language, not inference: an examination of the potential effectiveness of Natural American Spirit advertising restrictions","Objective: In 2017, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reached an agreement with Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company (SFNTC) stipulating that SFNTC will remove ’natural’ and ’additive-free’ from Natural American Spirit (NAS) marketing to combat misperceptions that NAS is a healthier cigarette. The purpose of this study was to assess experimentally the potential effectiveness of the agreement in addressing NAS misperceptions. Methods: In an online experiment, 820 current and former smokers were assigned randomly to advertising conditions with existing claims from NAS advertisements, modified claims or a no-exposure control. Advertising conditions included (1) ’original’ NAS advertising text before the agreement; (2) ’2017 agreement’ language permissible under the FDA–SFNTC agreement (removing ’natural’, ’additive-free’); (3) more restrictive (’stricter’) language representing additional regulation (removing ’natural’ from the brand name and the phrases ’tobacco+water’, ’no chemicals’). Participants completed outcome measures assessing misinformed beliefs and intentions towards NAS. Results: One-way ANOVA showed that relative to the ’original’ language, the ’2017 agreement’ language reduced misconceptions about NAS addictiveness, but not about health or constituent composition. Yet ’stricter’ language significantly reduced all categories of misinformed beliefs, which in turn mediated effects on (lower) intentions to use NAS. Conclusion: The 2017 agreement helps dispel some misconceptions about NAS addictiveness, but does not sufficiently rectify misinformation about health or composition. Since ’stricter’ language more effectively corrects misinformed beliefs, our results suggest the need for further regulations in addressing misinformation that drives intentions towards NAS.

"Burnout, depression and paranoid ideation: A cluster-analytic study","[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 69(1) of Occupational Medicine (see record 2019-12939-018). In the original version of this paper, a misleading statement was unintentionally included in the ‘Methods’ section. This has now been removed online and in print.] Background: A link between burnout and paranoid ideation has long been suspected. However, systematic research on the association has been scarce. Aims: We investigated the relationship between burnout and paranoid ideation. Because burnout overlaps with depression, depression was also examined. Methods: A total of 218 Swiss schoolteachers participated in the study (58% female; mean age: 47). Burnout symptoms were assessed with the emotional exhaustion (EE) and depersonalization (DP) subscales of the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Educators Survey, depressive symptoms with the PHQ-9 and paranoid ideation with the Green et al. Paranoid Thought Scales. Results: Burnout, depression and their subdimensions showed raw correlations ranging from 0.42 to 0.55 with paranoid ideation. Burnout, depression and paranoid thoughts were found to cluster together. Lower levels of burnout and depression coexisted with lower levels of paranoid ideation and higher levels of burnout and depression coexisted with higher levels of paranoid ideation. When corrected for measurement error, the correlations of EE with depression and DP were 0.96 and 0.57, respectively. A principal component analysis confirmed that EE was indistinguishable from depression. Conclusions: Burnout is substantially associated with paranoid ideation. Interestingly, EE correlated as strongly with paranoid ideation as it correlated with DP. Moreover, if burnout is a syndrome of EE and DP that excludes depression, then the EE-depression correlation should not be close to 1 and EE should not correlate more strongly with depression than with DP. These basic requirements for construct distinctiveness and syndromal unity were not satisfied.

Consumer perceptions of genetically modified foods: A mixed-method approach,"Purpose: This paper aims to examine consumers’ opinions and behavioral intentions toward foods labeled as containing genetically modified (GM) (transgenic) ingredients across plant and animal-based categories. In light of marketplace changes (i.e. labeling requirements), we explore behavioral measures based on labeling options. Design/methodology/approach: Three studies, one online projective survey using a convenience sample of consumers and two experiments conducted with Amazon mTurk adult US participants, are included. Findings: Consumers have negative associations with GM products vs non-GM and are more likely to purchase unlabeled GM products. GM products may offer positive economic, societal and environmental benefits. However, the need for labeling overshadows these benefits and presence of GM labeling increased avoidance. Furthermore, changes in product opinion mediate consumers’ purchase intention and willingness to pay. Research limitations/implications: GM labeling negatively influences consumers’ opinions and behavioral intentions. This is important for legislators and marketers concerned with counter-labeling effects (e.g. Non-GMO Project Verified). Practical implications: Debates on efficacy of labeling, inclusion disclosure of ingredients, short-term risks and long-term implications are ongoing globally. Consumer reception and purchase intention can only be changed through governmental and corporate transparency. Social implications: Widespread misinformation about GM foods, presence in our food supply, impact on health, economy, environment and the marketplace still exists. The findings reflect consumers’ responses to changes proposed by the 2016 National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard legislation. Originality/value: With the paucity of research on consumer response to the release of a GM animal product into the food supply, this work breaks new ground as the first to examine the impact of disclosure of GM animal-based food type.

Combating information attacks in the age of the internet: New challenges for cognitive engineering,"Objective: This article provides an overview of the characteristics of misinformation and information attack and their effects on the perceptions of the public, with the objective of outlining potential solutions and needed research for countering this growing problem. Background: Society is facing a significant challenge from the spread of misinformation through websites and social media that has driven a divergence in people’s perceptions and understanding of basic facts associated with many issues relevant to public policy decisions, including the economy, taxation, and the deficit; climate change and the environment; and vaccinations and public health and safety. A number of factors are driving this fracture, including information presentation challenges that lead to poor information understanding, deliberate information attacks, social network propagation, poor assessments of information reliability, and cognitive biases that lead to a rejection of information that conflicts with preexisting beliefs. Results: A framework for understanding information attack is provided, including common sources, features, avenues, cognitive mechanisms, and major challenges in overcoming information attacks. Conclusion and Application: Potential solutions and research needs are presented for improving people’s understanding of online information associated with a wide range of issues affecting public policy.

Prior exposure increases perceived accuracy of fake news,"The 2016 U.S. presidential election brought considerable attention to the phenomenon of “fake news”: entirely fabricated and often partisan content that is presented as factual. Here we demonstrate one mechanism that contributes to the believability of fake news: fluency via prior exposure. Using actual fake-news headlines presented as they were seen on Facebook, we show that even a single exposure increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy, both within the same session and after a week. Moreover, this “illusory truth effect” for fake-news headlines occurs despite a low level of overall believability and even when the stories are labeled as contested by fact checkers or are inconsistent with the reader’s political ideology. These results suggest that social media platforms help to incubate belief in blatantly false news stories and that tagging such stories as disputed is not an effective solution to this problem. It is interesting, however, that we also found that prior exposure does not impact entirely implausible statements (e.g., “The earth is a perfect square”). These observations indicate that although extreme implausibility is a boundary condition of the illusory truth effect, only a small degree of potential plausibility is sufficient for repetition to increase perceived accuracy. As a consequence, the scope and impact of repetition on beliefs is greater than has been previously assumed.

I do not believe you: How providing a source corrects health misperceptions across social media platforms,"Social media are often criticized as serving as a source of misinformation, but in this study we examine how they may also function to correct misperceptions on an emerging health issue. We use an experimental design to consider social correction that occurs via peers, testing both the type of correction (i.e., whether a source is provided or not) and the platform on which the correction ocratcurs (i.e., Facebook versus Twitter). Our results suggest that a source is necessary to correct misperceptions about the causes of the Zika virus on both Facebook and Twitter, but the mechanism by which such correction occurs differs across platforms. Implications for successful social media campaigns to address health misinformation are addressed.

Intentions to trust and share online health rumors: An experiment with medical professionals,"With the rise of fake news and doctored narratives on the Internet, research on online rumors is growing. Previous works often dealt with either individuals' trust in rumors or their willingness to share. Juxtaposing both in the same study, the aim of this paper is to investigate medical professionals' intentions to trust and share online health rumors as a function of their personal involvement, the rumor type, and the presence of counter-rumors. Personal involvement refers to individuals’ perceived relevance of a rumor. Two common types of rumors include dread and wish. Counter-rumors are messages that debunk rumors. A within-participants experiment was conducted with 60 participants, divided evenly among doctors, nurses and medical students, each of whom was exposed to eight cancer-related rumors. Rumor type and the presence of counter-rumors were induced. Personal involvement, intention to trust, and intention to share were measured using a questionnaire. Results showed that personal involvement compelled intentions to trust and share. Dread rumors triggered intentions to trust and share more than did wish rumors. The presence of counter-rumors lowered intention to trust, but not intention to share. Moreover, rumor type moderated the relation between personal involvement and intentions to trust and share.

Perceived risk of developing smoking-related disease among persons living with hiv,"Perceived risk of smoking is associated with smoking status, interest in quitting, cessation attempts, and quit success. Research is needed to explore risk perceptions of developing smoking-related disease among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Data came from 267 HIV-positive smokers who completed an online survey assessing perceived health risks associated with (a) generic smoking status; (b) generic non-smoking status; (c) their own personal current smoking; and (d) a hypothetical situation in which they were a non-smoker. PLWH perceived greater risk associated with their current smoking versus hypothetical personal non-smoking ( p’s &lt; 0.001), and greater risks associated with generic smoking status compared with their current smoking ( p’s &lt; 0.001). Being on HIV medication (β = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.17, 1.12), interest in quitting smoking (β = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.45, 1.32), and having an HIV healthcare provider who has recommended cessation (β = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.42, 1.67) were positively associated with perceived risk of developing smoking-related diseases. Findings have implications for developing targeted interventions to correct misperceptions regarding the health risks of smoking among PLWH, a population at particular risk for smoking and smoking-related morbidity and mortality.

Alternative package leaflets improve people's understanding of drug side effects—A randomized controlled exploratory survey,"Background: Current German and EU package leaflets (PLs) do not distinguish to what extent listed side effects are indeed side effects caused by drug intake or instead symptoms that occur regardless of drug use. We recently showed that most health professionals misinterpret the frequencies of listed side effects as solely caused by the drug. The present study investigated whether (1) these misinterpretations also prevail among laypeople and (2) alternative PLs reduce these misinterpretations. Methods: In March 2017, 397 out of 400 laypeople approached completed an online survey. They were randomized to one of four PL formats: three alternative PLs (drug facts box with/without reading instruction, narrative format with numbers) and one standard PL. Each PL listed four side effects for a fictitious drug: two were presented as occurring more often, one as equally often, and one as less often with drug intake. The alternative formats (interventions) included information on frequencies with and without drug intake and included a statement on the causal relation. The standard PL (control) only included information on frequency ranges with drug intake. Questions were asked on general occurrence and causality of side effects. Results: Participants randomized to the standard PL were unable to answer questions on causality. For side effects occurring more often (equally; less often) with drug intake, only 1.9% to 2.8% (equally: 1.9%; less often: 1.9%) provided correct responses about the causal nature of side effects, compared to 55.0% to 81.9% (equally: 23.8% to 70.5%; less often: 21.0% to 43.2%) of participants who received alternative PLs. It remains unclear whether one alternative format is superior to the others. Conclusion: In conclusion, information on the frequency of side effects in current package leaflets is misleading. Comparative presentation of frequencies for side effects with and without drug intake including statements on the causal relation significantly improves understanding.

"See something, say something: Correction of global health misinformation on social media","Social media are often criticized for being a conduit for misinformation on global health issues, but may also serve as a corrective to false information. To investigate this possibility, an experiment was conducted exposing users to a simulated Facebook News Feed featuring misinformation and different correction mechanisms (one in which news stories featuring correct information were produced by an algorithm and another where the corrective news stories were posted by other Facebook users) about the Zika virus, a current global health threat. Results show that algorithmic and social corrections are equally effective in limiting misperceptions, and correction occurs for both high and low conspiracy belief individuals. Recommendations for social media campaigns to correct global health misinformation, including encouraging users to refute false or misleading health information, and providing them appropriate sources to accompany their refutation, are discussed.

Health warning labels correct parents’ misperceptions about sugary drink options,"Introduction: Noncarbonated sugar-sweetened beverages, such as fruit drinks, sports drinks, and sweetened teas are increasingly promoted to and consumed by youth. These beverages may be perceived as healthier options than soda. To educate consumers about beverages high in added sugar, several cities and states have proposed policies mandating health warning labels on sugar-sweetened beverages. Methods: In 2015, a total of 2,381 parents were randomized to a no label, calorie label, or warning label condition. An online survey asked about the healthfulness of different beverages, and asked parents to select a beverage for their child in a choice task. Regressions compared the warning and calorie label groups to the control group and measured mediating effects of health beliefs on beverage choice. Data were analyzed in 2016. Results: Parents viewed fruit drinks, sports drinks, and sweetened teas as healthier and less likely to cause disease than soda. Compared with no label, warning labels significantly increased parents’ risk perceptions for all beverages except soda. Warning labels significantly reduced the odds of selecting fruit drinks for the child (OR= 0.42, 95% CI = 0.32, 0.56), and this effect was mediated by changes in health beliefs and risk perceptions. Conclusions: Fruit drinks, sports drinks, and sweetened teas are increasingly promoted to youth. Parents believe these beverages are healthier and less likely to cause disease than soda, and warning labels may correct these misperceptions.

How effective are messages and their characteristics in changing behavioural intentions to substitute plant-based foods for red meat? The mediating role of prior beliefs,"By means of a population-based survey experiment, we analysed the effectiveness of two message characteristics—message framing and the refutation of misinformation—in persuading respondents to reduce their consumption of red meat and increase that of plant-based alternatives. We also tested whether the effects of those two message characteristics were moderated by prior beliefs about the health and climate impacts of red meat consumption. The data were collected with an online survey of the adult population living in Finland (N = 1279). We found that messages had a small but desired effect on intentions when the effect of prior beliefs was taken into account, but that that effect was strongly moderated by prior beliefs. In particular, messages changed behavioural intentions among the “meat-sceptics” (i.e., those believing relatively strongly in the negative health and climate effects of meat consumption) but not among the “meat believers” (defined symmetrically). The combination of frames and refutation of misinformation were not found to be more effective strategies than the provision of information through single-framed, one-sided messages. We found limited evidence that the way a message was formulated determined its effectiveness in changing behaviours.

"Evaluating the effect of a campus-wide social norms marketing intervention on alcohol-use perceptions, consumption, and blackouts","Objective: To evaluate the effect of a campus-wide social norms marketing intervention on alcohol-use perceptions, consumption, and blackouts at a large, urban, public university. Participants: 4,172 college students (1,208 freshmen, 1,159 sophomores, 953 juniors, and 852 seniors) who completed surveys in Spring 2015 for the Spit for Science Study, a longitudinal study of students' substance use and emotional health. Methods: Participants were e-mailed an online survey that queried campaign readership, perception of peer alcohol use, alcohol consumption, frequency of consumption, and frequency of blackouts. Associations between variables were evaluated using path analysis. Results: We found that campaign readership was associated with more accurate perceptions of peer alcohol use, which, in turn, was associated with self-reported lower number of drinks per sitting and experiencing fewer blackouts. Conclusions: This evaluation supports the use of social norms marketing as a population-level intervention to correct alcohol-use misperceptions and reduce blackouts.

Clinician and parent perspectives on educational needs for increasing adolescent HPV vaccination,"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related morbidity and mortality remain a significant public health burden despite the availability of HPV vaccines for cancer prevention. We engaged clinicians and parents to identify barriers and opportunities related to adolescent HPV vaccination within a focused geographic region. This mixed-method study design used an interviewer-administered semi-structured interview with clinicians ( n = 52) and a written self-administered survey with similar items completed by parents ( n = 54). Items focused on experiences, opinions, and ideas about HPV vaccine utilization in the clinical setting, family, and patient perceptions about HPV vaccination and potential future efforts to increase vaccine utilization. Quantitative items were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while qualitative content was analyzed thematically. Suggested solutions for achieving higher rates of HPV vaccination noted by clinicians included public health education, the removal of stigma associated with vaccines, media endorsements, and targeting parents as the primary focus of educational messages. Parents expressed the need for more information about HPV-related disease, HPV vaccines, vaccine safety, sexual concerns, and countering misinformation on social media. Results from this mixed-method study affirm that educational campaigns targeting both health care professionals and parents represent a key facilitator for promoting HPV vaccination; disease burden and cancer prevention emerged as key themes for this messaging.

Effects of large cigarette warning labels on smokers' expected longevity,"Objectives: Smokers underestimate the health risks of smoking and overestimate their expected longevity. Warning labels on cigarette packs might help correct these misperceptions. Methods: We carried out an online study with 1200 smokers (18-62 years old), randomized to 3 conditions: text warning labels, pictorial warning labels, and a control group (water bottle labels). Warning labels were based on those proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010. Participants in each condition saw 4 randomly selected labels and rated their expected longevity and chances of surviving to age 75 after exposure. Analyses of covariance controlled for cigarettes per day and self-rated health. Results: Compared to control, both text and pictorial warnings reduced participants’ expected longevity (text: mean = 76.8 years, pictorial: 77.3, control 79.4) and their estimated chances of living to 75 (text: 62.0%, pictorial: 63.0%, control 66.5%). The contrast between text and pictorial labels combined and control showed significantly reduced expected longevity (p = .011) and chances of living to 75 (p = .004). Differences between text and pictorial conditions were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Large text or pictorial warnings on cigarette packs might help smokers develop a more accurate understanding of the effects of smoking on their longevity.

60 minutes for health: Examining the feasibility and acceptability of a low-resource behavioral intervention designed to promote retention in HIV care,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 30(2) of AIDS Care (see record 2018-01893-020). This article was originally published online with Table 1 incorrectly formatted. This has now been corrected and the article has been re-published.] Sustained retention in HIV medical care is a key health behavior for the long-term health of people living with HIV (PLWH). Approximately 60% of PLWH in the U.S. are poorly retained in HIV care, yet to date, the few available evidence-based retention-promoting interventions are resource and time intensive to implement. The current study describes the feasibility and acceptability of a theory-based retention-promoting intervention designed to meet the needs of a busy clinical care setting. 60 Minutes for Health reflects a low-resource single-session intervention, implemented by a health educator, to PLWH who have had a recent gap in care (≥ 6-months) in the past 18-months. Intervention content was informed by a situated application of the Information Motivation Behavioral Skills Model and delivered using a Motivational Interviewing-based format. The intervention uses a workbook to guide a series of activities that: (1) Identify and reduce misinformation guiding HIV care attendance. (2) Enhance motivation to maintain care via personal health goals. (3) Build skills for coping with emotional distress related to living with HIV. (4) Increase self-efficacy for navigating the logistics of maintaining care amidst competing priorities. A small feasibility pilot of this intervention protocol was conducted to assess its potential to improve retention in care and to obtain estimates for a larger-scale efficacy trial. Participants were randomized to the 60-minute intervention session ( n = 8), or a theory-based time-and-attention control session focused on diet and nutrition ( n = 8). Medical records were abstracted to evaluate changes in participants’ retention in care status at 12- and 24-months post-intervention. Findings suggest the intervention is both feasible and acceptable to implement with poorly retained PLWH in a clinic setting. Post-intervention a larger proportion of intervention participants were retained in care (12-months: 87.5%, 24-months: 62.5%), compared control participants (12-months: 50.0%, 24-months: 25.0%). Future work should aim to evaluate a larger-scale efficacy trial.

Selective exposure to misleading information in the new media environment by at-risk youth: A study of pro-smoking youtube videos,"Many pro-smoking videos on YouTube reach view counts in the hundreds of thousands and more. Yet, there is limited information on who is viewing these potentially misleading videos. Based on literature that suggests that positive portrayals of cigarette smoking are prevalent on YouTube and the fact that adolescents, who are the main users of YouTube, can be easily impacted by such misleading depictions, this dissertation focuses on furthering our understanding of pro-smoking videos, using youth (ages 15-21) with varying levels of interest in smoking as main subjects. Specifically, this dissertation is aimed at identifying the viewership and potential impact of smoking promotion YouTube videos. In an attempt to answer the question of who is viewing these videos, Study 1 was a selective exposure experiment that examined browsing patterns of youth who were given a choice set of 16 videos (eight smoking and eight non-smoking). Behavioral data revealed that youth with high interest in smoking were more likely to select and spend more time watching pro-smoking videos than were youth with lower interest in smoking. A secondary finding was that when given the impression that smoking videos were popular by manipulating view count, youth held more positive attitudes toward smoking. Study 2 examined post-exposure data collected as part of the selective exposure study. Correlational results showed that there was a significant positive association between selection of pro-smoking videos and smoking-related outcomes such as norms and attitudes. Youth with high interest in smoking also had more positive reactions to pro-smoking videos compared with their less interested counterparts. To establish directionality of the relationship between exposure and persuasion, Study 3 examined whether there were any direct effects of exposure to pro-smoking videos on smoking-related outcomes for youth interested in smoking. Contrary to expectations, there was no evidence that exposure to pro-smoking videos negatively impacted smoking-related outcomes. Therefore, an intervention to correct or inoculate against pro-smoking videos was not necessary, negating the need for a correctives study that had originally been proposed as part of this dissertation. Possible explanations for the findings are discussed along with implications and future directions for research.

Swaying pseudoscience: The inoculation effect,"In scientific research, pursuit of truth is the ultimate goal: to explain and to understand, using testable ideas and relying on evidence. Systematic and dynamic, science gleans and organizes information. It is a ceaseless process, a system for investigating phenomena, acquiring new knowledge, and correcting and integrating previous knowledge. For the scientific community to deem anything ""science,"" it must be based on hard evidence subject to testing, rejection, and confirmation. If you're reading this book, whether as a bona fide scientist, science communicator, or science enthusiast, this is old news to you. Fighting pseudoscience is a different beast and must rely on different techniques. Too often, fighting pseudoscience outside the realm of research devolves into the pursuit of being right; battles fought with citations, corpses of hurt pride left to decay. And while truth is a thing of beauty, fighting pseudoscience isn't necessarily about pedantry or self-righteousness, but progress and justice. To switch gears from science to confronting pseudoscience is a conscious back and forth, a tangible mind shift one must undertake consciously when called for. We must stay cognizant, and check ourselves and our colleagues when we slip into holier-than-thou fact flinging. They say you can't see the forest for the trees. Trees are for science. Forests are for the front lines of fighting pseudoscience. From a mic drop on a mainstream TV stage to a social media argument, each discussion is only a mile in the marathon, a battle in a war.

Exploring a threat-focused acquisition methodology using multi-criteria decision methods to increase delivery-cycles for information and cyber-related capabilities,"The use of information has dramatically changed over the past decade. In addition to traditional cyber-attacks, there has been an increase in the use of social-media to spread misinformation and opinion through the internet. The United States Department of Defense (DOD) is actively developing capabilities to defend against these cyberspace and information threats. Unfortunately, one of the principal dilemmas of this challenge is the speed at which these threats can be introduced. Adversaries are not constrained by U.S. regulations allowing deployment of new threats simply by modifying an available commercial product or application. The DOD needs similar agility to deliver counter-threat capabilities while remaining compliant with regulations. This research centers on increasing the government's delivery speed by adding a transformational threat-focused acquisition method to compliment the traditional capability-based development process. The DOD's current resourcing, programming, and acquisition processes are studied to offer a pragmatic synergistic threat-focused approach to continuously resource, research, and provide the latest in available technology to the information environment. This recommended approach offers an institutional method to acquire technology targeting delivery within months while maintaining the inherent ability to annually transition these products into the traditional process for sustainability. To enhance the speed of the research and refresh capability, the use of multi-criteria decision models (MCDM) are evaluated to accelerate the assessment of alternatives and engineering trade-offs. A mathematical model is provided to assess the selection of decision criteria and moreover its impact on the final alternative selection. Sensitivity analysis techniques are then used to identify the points where outcome probabilities are subject to change given different criteria. Ultimately, a stable methodology to accelerate the DOD's acquisition of cyber-unique capabilities is provided.

Educational nueromyths: Prevalence among pre-service special education teachers,"Educational neuromyths are commonly accepted, erroneous beliefs that contribute to pseudoscientific practice within education (e.g., learning styles, right brain vs. left brain learners, perceptual motor training). The implementation of instructional practices founded upon neuromyths and lacking in empirical evidence diminishes the quality of classroom instruction for k-12 students. Extant research studies indicate strong beliefs in educational neuromyths among teachers in other countries. The purpose of this study was to examine the perspectives of special education pre-service teachers in the United States related to educational neuromyths and corresponding instructional practices. This mixed-methods sequential explanatory study was guided by the following main research questions: (a) What are pre-service teachers' perceptions of educational neuromyths and general knowledge of the brain, learning, and behavior?; (b) What is the relation between perceptions of neuromyths and likelihood to implement corresponding instructional practices?; and (c) What is the relation between demographic factors and beliefs in educational neuromyths and general knowledge of the brain, learning, and behavior? To address these research questions, I administered an adapted survey instrument and conducted online followup interviews. Participants' (n=131) responses to the survey instrument indicate misperceptions of neuromyths and moderate gaps in general knowledge of the brain, learning, and behavior. Correlation analyses and Kruskal Wallis tests suggest that participants who are aware of neuromyths are slightly more likely to implement effective instructional practices. A moderate, positive correlation was demonstrated between number of education courses and correct neuromyth responses. Education courses, not science courses, appear to better prepare students to identify neuromyths. Additionally, data demonstrate moderate positive correlation between perceived level of preparedness and incorrect responses to neuromyths statements. Qualitative findings suggest interview participants (n=6) are confused by the terminology surrounding educational neuromyths and other instructional approaches (e.g., UDL, differentiation). Recommendations for ameliorating deleterious effects of neuromyths in k-12 classrooms include augmenting current teacher education curricula, increasing pre-service teachers' scientific literacy, and developing collaborative interdisciplinary partnerships with neuroscience researchers.

"Misperceptions of the social world: What we get wrong about sex, race, money, and violence","This volume elucidates some of die very concrete ways in which Americans misperceive the social world and how we are all subject to biases and illusions. As such, it challenges the assumption in much social science theorizing that people are rational actors by exploring how the machinations of cognition, the effect of our past experiences, die news, and social media feeds all factor into our opinion-making process. The chapters highlight common, and often incorrect, perceptions of population diversity, sexual behavior, the economy, health, and relationships. It shows how correcting these misperceptions of the social world can lead to real behavioral and attitudinal change.

Perceived academic benefit is associated with nonmedical prescription stimulant use among college students,"Introduction: College students are at higher than average risk for nonmedical use of prescription stimulants (NPS). A commonly identified motive among students who engage in NPS is to improve grades. Several research studies have observed that NPS most likely does not confer an academic advantage, and is associated with excessive drinking and other drug use. This study documents the proportion of the general college student population who believe that NPS will lead to improvements in academic performance. Methods: This study gathered online survey data from a large, demographically diverse sample of college students to document the prevalence of perceived academic benefit of NPS for improving grades and to examine the association between such belief and NPS. Results: Overall, 28.6% agreed or strongly agreed that NPS could help students earn higher grades, and an additional 38.0% were unsure. Students with a higher level of perceived academic benefit of NPS and more frequent patterns of drinking and marijuana use were more likely to engage in NPS, even after adjustment for a wide range of covariates. Conclusions: The results underscore the need for interventions that simultaneously correct misperceptions related to academic benefit and target alcohol and marijuana use to reduce NPS.

Countering indoor tanning arguments: An experiment using skin cancer prevention messages,"Young adult Caucasian women are disproportionately affected by melanoma, and many of these cases are preventable as indoor tanning bed use has been attributed to the steady increase in melanoma incidence. While many prevention efforts have focused on informing young women of the negative health effects associated with tanning bed use, studies have demonstrated that young women are typically aware of the cancer risks associated with indoor tanning, but continue to tan despite this knowledge. A vast amount of misinformation about the benefits of indoor tanning has been identified, suggesting the need for a novel messaging intervention approach. This dissertation project details a systematic approach to the development and testing of indoor tanning messaging guided by Inoculation Theory. To understand the communication environment surrounding indoor tanning and the prevalence and domains of misinformation, a systematic content analysis of pro-tanning websites was conducted. Guided by results from the content analysis, three message types were created: 1) two-sided refutational (i.e., inoculation) messages were developed in concordance with inoculation theory to explicitly address and correct misinformation about indoor tanning benefits; 2) one-sided persuasive messages were developed to address correct information, without acknowledging opposing arguments; and 3) a control message was developed to be free of strong persuasive arguments, but stated facts about indoor tanning. Messages were first tested qualitatively with young adult women in cognitive interviews (N=8), followed by quantitative methods in the form of an online pilot experiment (N=177). The most promising messages were selected based on this qualitative and quantitative formative research and tested in a longitudinal online messaging experiment with young adult women (N=649 baseline; N=324 one-week follow-up). Results from the content analysis revealed two major domains of misinformation: safety and health. Within safety benefits of tanning, the most prevalent claims were about 1) controlled tanning in a bed (e.g., time spent and exposure to UV rays), and 2) government regulation of tanning beds. Within health benefits of tanning, the most common claims were 1) tanning beds provide a base tan that protects against future sun damage, and 2) tanning beds are a good source of vitamin D. The pilot experiment indicated that the controlled tanning (safety) and vitamin D (health) messages were most effective across conditions and were selected for testing in the full experiment. In the main experiment, those exposed to inoculation and one-sided messages reported fewer positive health outcome expectations and greater negative health outcome expectations compared to the control condition. Those in the inoculation condition rated messages higher in perceived effectiveness, reported lower intentions to tan indoors, and more cognitive processing compared to one-sided and control conditions. At one-week follow-up, while those in the one-sided condition reported an increase in positive outcome expectations and intentions to indoor tan, those in the inoculation reported decreases in positive outcome expectations and intentions relative to the control condition, and more counterarguing and cognitive processing relative to the one-sided condition. Overall, results indicate that inoculation messages are a promising approach for addressing misinformation about the safety and health benefits of indoor tanning. Implications for indoor tanning prevention efforts, inoculation theory, and health communication are discussed.

"Exploring the relationship between online buyers and sellers of image and performance enhancing drugs (IPEDs): Quality issues, trust and self-regulation","Background: Online drug markets are expanding the boundaries of drug supply including the sale and purchase of image and performance enhancing drugs (IPEDs). However, the role of the internet in IPED markets, and in particular the ways in which these substances are supplied via the surface web, has rarely been considered. This article examines the online IPED market in order to inform drug policy and to provide a nuanced understanding of retailers involved, particularly exploring the relationship between buyers and sellers. Methods: This paper is based on two extensive research projects conducted in the Netherlands and Belgium. The first project focuses on muscle drugs and is based on 64 IPED dealing cases, semi-structured interviews with authorities (N = 32), and dealers (N = 15), along with an analysis of 10 steroid-selling websites. The second research project primarily focuses on weight loss drugs and sexual enhancers in the Netherlands, and relies on interviews with authorities (N = 38), suppliers (N = 30), and consumers (N = 10), analysis of 69 criminal case files, and an online analysis. Results: In the literature, the illicit online sale of IPEDs is generally associated with illegal online pharmacies that try to mislead buyers. While confirmed in our research, we also illustrate that there are online suppliers who invest in customer relationships and services, and that users are aware of the illegal nature of their business. These e-vendors incorporate a ‘social supply business model’ by providing the best possible service to their customers and attempting to minimise risks in order to attract, satisfy and maintain customers. Conclusion: As it is likely that users will continue to make use of the internet to order IPEDs, regardless of closing down selling websites, it is first of all important to counteract these online sources by educating all types of consumers and providing harm reduction services.

"""Knowledge about e-cigarette constituents and regulation: Results from a national survey of U.S. young adults"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Knowledge about E-cigarette constituents and regulation: Results from a national survey of U.S. young adults"" by Ashley N. Sanders-Jackson, Andy S. L. Tan, Cabral A. Bigman and Lisa Henriksen ( Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research , 2015[Oct], Vol 17[10], 1247-1254). In the original article, an error was discovered in the second paragraph of the Discussion section and an error in Supplementary table 1. The corrections are given in the erratum and correction of table is present online. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-42983-010). Objectives: To examine young adults’ knowledge of e-cigarette constituents and regulation and its association with product use and self-reported exposure to marketing. Methods: Young adults (18–34 years, N = 1,247) from a U.S. web panel were surveyed in March 2014. Using multinomial logistic regressions, self-reported exposure to marketing was examined as a predictor of whether participants responded correctly (reference category), incorrectly, or ""don’t know"" to four knowledge items—whether e-cigarettes contain nicotine, contain toxic chemicals, are regulated by government for safety, and are regulated for use as a cessation aid. Analyses adjusted for demographics and smoking status and were weighted to match the U.S. young adult population. Results: Most respondents did not know if e-cigarettes, contain toxic chemicals (48%), are regulated for safety (61%), and are regulated as cessation aids (68%); fewer than 37% answered all of these items correctly. Current users of e-cigarettes (past 30 days) had a lower likelihood of being incorrect about safety testing ( p = .006) and being regulated as a cessation aid ( p = .017). Higher exposure to e-cigarette marketing was associated with a lower likelihood of responding ""don’t know"" than being correct, and with a higher likelihood of being incorrect as opposed to correct about e-cigarettes containing nicotine. Conclusions: Knowledge about e-cigarette constituents and regulation was low among young adults, who are the largest consumer group for these products. Interventions, such as warning labels or information campaigns, may be necessary to educate and correct misinformation about these products.

Debunking in a world of tribes,"Social media aggregate people around common interests eliciting collective framing of narratives and worldviews. However, in such a disintermediated environment misinformation is pervasive and attempts to debunk are often undertaken to contrast this trend. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of debunking on Facebook through a quantitative analysis of 54 million users over a time span of five years (Jan 2010, Dec 2014). In particular, we compare how users usually consuming proven (scientific) and unsubstantiated (conspiracy-like) information on Facebook US interact with specific debunking posts. Our findings confirm the existence of echo chambers where users interact primarily with either conspiracy-like or scientific pages. However, both groups interact similarly with the information within their echo chamber. Then, we measure how users from both echo chambers interacted with 50,220 debunking posts accounting for both users consumption patterns and the sentiment expressed in their comments. Sentiment analysis reveals a dominant negativity in the comments to debunking posts. Furthermore, such posts remain mainly confined to the scientific echo chamber. Only few conspiracy users engage with corrections and their liking and commenting rates on conspiracy posts increases after the interaction.

Copying@Scale: Using harvesting accounts for collecting correct answers in a MOOC,"This paper presents a detailed study of a form of academic dishonesty that involves the use of multiple accounts for harvesting solutions in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). It is termed CAMEO—Copying Answers using Multiple Existence Online. A person using CAMEO sets up one or more harvesting accounts for collecting correct answers; these are then submitted in the user's master account for credit. The study has three main goals: Determining the prevalence of CAMEO, studying its detailed characteristics, and inferring the motivation(s) for using it. For the physics course that we studied, about 10% of the certificate earners used this method to obtain more than 1% of their correct answers, and more than 3% of the certificate earners used it to obtain the majority (&gt;50%) of their correct answers. We discuss two of the likely consequences of CAMEO: jeopardizing the value of MOOC certificates as academic credentials, and generating misleading conclusions in educational research. Based on our study, we suggest methods for reducing CAMEO. Although this study was conducted on a MOOC, CAMEO can be used in any learning environment that enables students to have multiple accounts.

Pharmacists' perceptions of professionalism on social networking sites,"Background: Social networking sites (SNS) are a new venue for communication, and health care professionals, like the general population, are using them extensively. However, their behavior on SNS may influence public perceptions about their professionalism. Objective: This study explored how pharmacists separate professional and personal information and activities on SNS, their perceptions of professional behavior on SNS, and opinions on guidelines in this area. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with international practising pharmacists ( n = 31) recruited from a range of countries ( n = 9). Initially, pharmacists known to the research team were invited, and thereafter, participants were recruited using a snowballing technique. The interviews lasted from 30 to 120 min. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed. Results: A majority of participants mixed professional and personal information and activities on SNS, and about one third adopted a separation strategy where professional information and activities were clearly separated from personal ones (e.g. two different SNS accounts, or one particular SNS for professional use and another platform for personal purposes). Most participants expressed concern over how pharmacists present themselves and behave in SNS when they reported (un)professional behaviors of peers they had observed. Examples of perceived unprofessional behaviors included revealing details of personal life and activities; open complaints about the pharmacy sector, co-workers, physicians, and patients; inappropriate description of pharmacists' roles and activities; and breaches of patient confidentiality. Positive professional behaviors, such as expression of compassion for patients, examples of effective patient management, promotion of pharmacists' role, and correction of misleading health information being spread online were also observed. There was no consensus on having professional social media guidelines. Some preferred SNS to be unregulated while most believed certain guidance was needed to maintain high professional standards in the online environment. Conclusions: A definitive strategy to separate professional and personal information and activities on SNS was not adopted by most pharmacists. E-professionalism issues could negatively impact on the standing of individual practitioners and the profession. Most agreed that education about SNS use would be beneficial; however, support for guidelines or regulations for pharmacists' use of SNS was not unanimous.

Correction of misleading information in prescription drug television advertising: The roles of advertisement similarity and time delay,"Background: Prescription drug television advertisements containing potentially consequential misinformation sometimes appear in the United States. When that happens, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can request that companies distribute corrective advertisements to address misinformation and inaccurate claims. Previous research has demonstrated effectiveness in corrective advertising for various products. Objectives: The present article builds on that work with a randomized experimental study (n = 6454) of corrective advertising investigating the extent to which visual similarity matters between violative and corrective ads and the extent to which time delay matters between violative and corrective advertisement exposure. Methods: Our study sample included overweight or obese U.S. adults recruited from an existing online consumer panel representative of the U.S. adult population. We created a brand for a fictitious prescription weight-loss drug and produced corresponding direct-to-consumer (DTC) television ads. All participants viewed the same violative ad, but were randomly assigned to view corrective ads with different levels of visual similarity and exposure time delay using a 4 × 4 between-subjects factorial design. Results: Results suggest corrective ad exposure can influence consumer perceptions of drug efficacy, risks, and benefits previously established by violative ads that overstated drug efficacy, broadened drug indication, and omitted important risk information. Corrective ads also can weaken consumer intentions to consider and investigate a drug. However, ad similarity does not appear to affect consumer perceptions and preferences. Although we found that the effects of violative ad exposure tend to diminish over time, the length of the delay between violative and corrective ad exposure has limited influence. An exception to this was observed with regard to recall of drug benefits and risks, where the impact of corrective ad exposure increases with greater time delay. Conclusions: These results extend previous research to a new health condition and hold implications for regulatory policy.

Brief online interventions targeting risk and protective factors for increased and problematic alcohol use among American college students studying abroad,"Research documents increased and problematic alcohol use during study abroad experiences for college students yet no research documents effective preventive programs with these students. The present randomized controlled trial was designed to prevent increased and problematic alcohol use abroad by correcting misperceptions of peer drinking norms abroad and by promoting positive and healthy adjustment into the host culture (i.e., sojourner adjustment) through brief online personalized feedback interventions. A sample of 343 study abroad college students was randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions including a personalized normative feedback intervention (PNF), a sojourner adjustment feedback intervention (SAF), a combined PNF + SAF intervention, and an assessment-only control condition. Generalized estimated equation analyses accounting for baseline drinking and consequences revealed an intervention effect for PNF that was mitigated by baseline drinking level, such that PNF was best for those with lighter baseline drinking, but heavier baseline drinkers receiving PNF alone or PNF + SAF drank comparatively similar or more heavily abroad to those in the control condition. However, PNF + SAF condition participants with greater baseline levels of consequences reported comparatively less consequences abroad than their control participants. Thus, PNF alone may be helpful for lighter drinkers at predeparture and the addition of SAF to PNF may help prevent consequences abroad for those reporting more consequences prior to departure abroad. This research represents an important first step in designing and implementing efficacious interventions with at-risk study abroad college students, for which no current empirically based programs exist.

The Oxford handbook of the science of science communication,"The proposal to vaccinate adolescent girls against the human papilloma virus ignited political controversy, as did the advent of tracking and a host of other emerging technologies. These disputes attest to the persistent gap between expert and public perceptions. Complicating the communication of sound science and the debates that surround the societal applications of that science is a changing media environment in which misinformation can elicit belief without corrective context and like minded individuals are prone to seek ideologically comforting information within their own self-constructed media enclaves. Drawing on the expertise of leading science communication scholars from six countries, The Oxford Handbook of the Science of Science Communication not only charts the media landscape—from news and entertainment to blogs and films—but also examines the powers and perils of human biases—from the disposition to seek confirming evidence to the inclination to overweight endpoints in a trend line. In the process, it draws together the best available social science on ways to communicate science while also minimizing the pernicious effects of human bias. The Handbook adds case studies exploring instances in which communication undercut or facilitated the access to scientific evidence. The range of topics addressed is wide, from genetically engineered organisms arid nanotechnology to vaccination controversies and climate change. Also unique to this book is a focus on the complexities of involving the public in decision making about the uses of science, the regulations that should govern its application, and the ethical boundaries within which science should operate. The Handbook is an invaluable resource for researchers in the communication fields, particularly in science and health communication, as well as to scholars involved in research on scientific topics susceptible to distortion in partisan debate.

Supporting neonatal intensive care unit parents through social media,"Parents of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit may often find themselves seeking healthcare information from online and social media sources. Social media applications are available to healthcare consumers and their families, as well as healthcare providers, in a variety of formats. Information that parents gather on their own, and information that is explained by providers, is then used when parents make healthcare decisions regarding their infants. Parents also seek support from peers and family while making healthcare decisions. The combination of knowledge obtained and social support given may empower the parent to feel more confident in their decision making. Healthcare professionals can guide parents to credible resources. The exchange of information between providers and parents can occur using a variety of communication methods. Misperceptions can be corrected, support given, open sharing of information occurs, and parent empowerment may result.

"""Social Thinking®: Science, pseudoscience, or antiscience?"": Erratum","Reports an error in ""Social thinking®: Science, psuedoscience, or antiscience"" by Justin B. Leaf, Alyne Kassardjian, Misty L. Oppenheim-Leaf, Joseph H. Cihon, Mitchell Taubman, Ronald Leaf and John McEachin ( Behavior Analysis in Practice , Advanced Online Publication, Jan 26, 2016, np). In the original article, a paragraph that referred to the Behavior Analyst Certification Board’s (BACB®) ethics code and disciplinary system in relation to certified behavior analysts who would implement, recommend, or endorse Social Thinking® was incorrectly added from the original manuscript. The corrected paragraph is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2016-04880-001). Today, there are several interventions that can be implemented with individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Most of these interventions have limited to no empirical evidence demonstrating their effectiveness, yet they are widely implemented in home, school, university, and community settings. In 1996, Green wrote a chapter in which she outlined three levels of science: evidence science, pseudoscience, and antiscience; professionals were encouraged to implement and recommend only those procedures that would be considered evidence science. Today, an intervention that is commonly implemented with individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is Social Thinking®. This intervention has been utilized by behaviorists and non-behaviorists. This commentary will outline Social Thinking® and provide evidence that the procedure, at the current time, qualifies as a pseudoscience and, therefore, should not be implemented with individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, especially given the availability of alternatives which clearly meet the standard of evidence science.

Problem drug use prevalence estimation revisited: Heterogeneity in capture–recapture and the role of external evidence,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 111(5) of Addiction (see record 2016-18061-025). In the original article, the online Appendix was not included at the time of issue publication. The Supporting Information has now been added at the end of the paper and now appears online at http://onlinelibrary. wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.13222/epdf.] Background and Aims Capture–recapture (CRC) analysis is recommended for estimating the prevalence of problem drug use or people who inject drugs (PWID). We aim to demonstrate how naive application of CRC can lead to highly misleading results, and to suggest how the problems might be overcome. Methods We present a case study of estimating the prevalence of PWID in Bristol, UK, applying CRC to lists in contact with three services. We assess: (i) sensitivity of results to different versions of the dominant (treatment) list: specifically, to inclusion of non‐incident cases and of those who were referred directly from one of the other services; (ii) the impact of accounting for a novel covariate, housing instability; and (iii) consistency of CRC estimates with drug‐related mortality data. We then incorporate formally the drug‐related mortality data and lower bounds for prevalence alongside the CRC into a single coherent model. Results Five of 11 models fitted the full data equally well but generated widely varying prevalence estimates, from 2740 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2670, 2840] to 6890 (95% CI = 3740, 17680). Results were highly sensitive to inclusion of non‐incident cases, demonstrating the presence of considerable heterogeneity, and were sensitive to a lesser extent to inclusion of direct referrals. A reduced data set including only incident cases and excluding referrals could be fitted by simpler models, and led to much greater consistency in estimates. Accounting for housing stability improved model fit considerably more than did the standard covariates of age and gender. External data provided validation of results and aided model selection, generating a final estimate of the number of PWID in Bristol in 2011 of 2770 [95% credible interval (Cr‐I) = 2570, 3110] or 0.9% (95% Cr‐I = 0.9, 1.0%) of the population aged 15–64 years. Conclusions Steps can be taken to reduce bias in capture–recapture analysis, including: careful consideration of data sources, reduction of lists to less heterogeneous subsamples, use of covariates and formal incorporation of external data.

"""Relation of motor, linguistic and temperament factors in epidemiologic subtypes of persistent and recovered stuttering: Initial findings"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Relation of motor, linguistic and temperament factors in epidemiologic subtypes of persistent and recovered stuttering: Initial findings"" by Nicoline G. Ambrose, Ehud Yairi, Torrey M. Loucks, Carol Hubbard Seery and Rebecca Throneburg ( Journal of Fluency Disorders , Advanced Online Publication, Jun 1, 2015, np). The original article contains a misleading error in citing Olander, Smith, and Zelaznik (2010) regarding hand clapping coordination variability scores in early childhood and persistence or recovery from stuttering. The corrected information and citation are provided in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-29096-001). PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of any patterns reflecting underlying subtypes of persistence and recovery across epidemiologic, motor, language, and temperament domains in the same group of children beginning to stutter and followed for several years. METHODS: Participants were 58 2–4-year-old CWS and 40 age and gender matched NFC from four different sites in the Midwest. At the end of the multi-year study, stuttering children were classified as Persistent or Recovered. The same protocol obtaining data to measure stuttering, motor, language and temperament characteristics was used at each site. They have not been included in previous reports. RESULTS: The Persistent group performed consistently differently from the Recovered and Control groups. They performed lower on standardized language tests and in phonological accuracy, had greater kinematic variability, and were judged by their parents to be more negative in temperament. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides data supporting the hypothesis that subtypes of stuttering can be identified along persistency/recovery lines, but results were not definitive.Educational Objectives: Readers will be able to (a) describe the current state of subtypes of stuttering research; (b) summarize possible contributions of epidemiologic, motoric, linguistic and temperament to such subtyping with regard to persistency and recovery.

"Retracting, replacing, and correcting the literature for pervasive error in which the results change but the underlying science is still reliable","In this issue of JAMA Psychiatry , Lopes and colleagues request retraction and replacement of their article titled “Gamma Ventral Capsulotomy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Randomized Clinical Trial.” After an error was discovered by Baethge, as also reported in a letter herein (see record 2015-55104-022), the authors reviewed the data and confirmed an important but inadvertent error had occurred. As the authors explain in their letter to the editor, this error involved a miscomputation of a treatment response for 1 of the 8 trial participants in the treatment group. This error resulted in an erroneous Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale score of 36 instead of 30 for that participant, which the authors counted as a responder to the treatment rather than a nonresponder. Thus, the number of responders in the treatment group at 12 months (as per the primary outcome reported in the trial protocol) is 2 of 8 participants rather than the originally reported 3 of 8 participants. Because of this error, the authors reconducted the analysis and provided a corrected article with corrections to the Abstract; Results, Discussion, and Conclusions sections of the article; and relevant tables and figures in the article and online supplement. The authors have confirmed that there are no additional errors. The corrected article has been reviewed and we have confirmed that the primary outcome has changed as stated in the corrected article: “Two of 8 patients randomized to active treatment responded at 12 months, and none of the 8 sham-GVC patients responded (the absolute difference was not statistically significant: 0.25; 95% CI, 0.05-0.55; P = .11).” Retractions are typically reserved for articles that have resulted from scientific misconduct, such as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism, or from pervasive error for which the results cannot be substantiated. In scientific publication, a pervasive error could result from a coding problem or a miscalculation and results in extensive inaccuracies throughout an article (eg, abstract, methods, results, discussion, conclusions, tables, and figures). Publication of pervasive incorrect data resulting in a major change in the direction or significance of the results, interpretations, and conclusions, as occurred with the trial reported by Lopes et al, is a serious matter. However, in this case, the error was inadvertent and the underlying science is still reliable and important. Thus,we now publish this notice of retraction and replacement with explanation from the authors and a corrected replacement article (see record 2015-55104-023) as we believe it is important for readers, investigators, and clinicians to have access to correct results of this trial. We have included a version of the original retracted article showing the original errors and a version of the replacement article showing what was corrected in the online supplement of the corrected replacement article.

Knowledge about E-cigarette constituents and regulation: Results from a national survey of U.S. young adults,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 19(9) of Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research (see record 2018-02543-026). In the original article, an error was discovered in the second paragraph of the Discussion section and an error in Supplementary table 1. The corrections are given in the erratum and correction of table is present online.] Objectives: To examine young adults’ knowledge of e-cigarette constituents and regulation and its association with product use and self-reported exposure to marketing. Methods: Young adults (18–34 years, N = 1,247) from a U.S. web panel were surveyed in March 2014. Using multinomial logistic regressions, self-reported exposure to marketing was examined as a predictor of whether participants responded correctly (reference category), incorrectly, or ""don’t know"" to four knowledge items—whether e-cigarettes contain nicotine, contain toxic chemicals, are regulated by government for safety, and are regulated for use as a cessation aid. Analyses adjusted for demographics and smoking status and were weighted to match the U.S. young adult population. Results: Most respondents did not know if e-cigarettes, contain toxic chemicals (48%), are regulated for safety (61%), and are regulated as cessation aids (68%); fewer than 37% answered all of these items correctly. Current users of e-cigarettes (past 30 days) had a lower likelihood of being incorrect about safety testing ( p = .006) and being regulated as a cessation aid ( p = .017). Higher exposure to e-cigarette marketing was associated with a lower likelihood of responding ""don’t know"" than being correct, and with a higher likelihood of being incorrect as opposed to correct about e-cigarettes containing nicotine. Conclusions: Knowledge about e-cigarette constituents and regulation was low among young adults, who are the largest consumer group for these products. Interventions, such as warning labels or information campaigns, may be necessary to educate and correct misinformation about these products.

Socializing in emergencies: A review of the use of social media in emergency situations,"Social media tools are integrated in most parts of our daily lives, as citizens, netizens, researchers or emergency responders. Lessons learnt from disasters and emergencies that occurred globally in the last few years have shown that social media tools may serve as an integral and significant component of crisis response. Communication is one of the fundamental tools of emergency management. It becomes crucial when there are dozens of agencies and organizations responding to a disaster. Regardless of the type of emergency, whether a terrorist attack, a hurricane or an earthquake, communication lines may be overloaded and cellular networks overwhelmed as too many people attempt to use them to access information. Social scientists have presented that post-disaster active public participation was largely altruistic, including activities such as search and rescue, first aid treatment, victim evacuation, and on-line help. Social media provides opportunities for engaging citizens in the emergency management by both disseminating information to the public and accessing information from them. During emergency events, individuals are exposed to large quantities of information without being aware of their validity or risk of misinformation, but users are usually swift to correct them, thus making the social media “self-regulating”.

A biomimetic approach to non-linear signal processing in ultra low power analog circuits,"The human brain has perfected the task of performing complex functions, such as learning, memory, and cognition, in energy and area efficient manners, and therefore, it is attractive to model and replicate this performance in biomimetic systems. Applications for which such models are essential include implantable electronics that replace certain brain functions damaged by diseases or injury, and neuromorphic architectures for novel high-speed, low power computing. To properly mimic a neural function, it is important to determine the optimal level of abstraction because there are trade-offs between capturing biological complexities and the scalability and efficiency of the model. Additionally, the hardware implementation of that model must consume little power to minimize heat dissipation in order to avoid tissue damage and to allow for scaling to a large number of components. The Laguerre Expansion of Volterra (LEV) model is a promising approach since it can capture the spatio-temporal nonlinearities of a neural system at several abstraction levels. Similar to the brain, it uses basic processing strategies and operations like amplification, filtering, delay, and redundancy to produce complex functionalities. This doctoral research addresses the hardware challenges of a biomimetic system and proposes a novel method for its practical implementation. The LEV model is realized using analog subthreshold CMOS signal processing units, which are more power and area efficient than the digital counterparts. Several challenges in subthreshold analog design are addressed in this work. First, application-specific analog circuits are neither easily programmable nor flexible. Second, in the subthreshold regime mismatch and process variations lead to large differences in identically-sized transistors. The brain performs complex functions despite facing similar limitations by using redundancy and learning rules that adjust cell properties. Guided by these principles the analog subthreshold circuits are designed to be digitally programmable for coefficient and time constant adjustments. Also, since Laguerre basis functions of different orders are not completely orthogonal, a redundancy is created that helps reproduce the composite waveform more accurately. Calibration and training techniques are proposed in this work to accomplish the required precision. These techniques are verified through numerical simulations, and physical implementation and measurement of a system fabricated in a 0.13 m CMOS process. This work demonstrates the utility of these optimized low-power subthreshold analog circuits, aided by calibration, and uses them to implement the LEV model of a single-input, single-output spike system to replicate the signal transformations of a single neuron. A foundation is laid for an easily scalable system useful for multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) models, to be used in systems such as a hippocampus prosthesis for memory restoration or a large scale neuromorphic computer.

Counter-advertising may reduce parent's susceptibility to front-of-package promotions on unhealthy foods,"Objective: Assess the effect of counter-advertisements on parents' appraisals of unhealthy foods featuring front-of-package promotions (FOPPs). Design: A 2 × 2 × 5 between-subjects Web-based experiment. Parents were randomly shown an advertisement (counter-advertisement challenging FOPP/control advertisement) and then a pair of food products from the same category: an unhealthy product featuring an FOPP (nutrient content claim/sports celebrity endorsement) and a healthier control product with no FOPP. Setting: Australia. Participants: A total of 1,269 Australian-based parents of children aged 5–12 years recruited from an online panel. Main Outcome Measures: Parents nominated which product they would prefer to buy and which they thought was healthier, then rated the unhealthy product and FOPP on various characteristics. Analysis: Differences between advertisement conditions were assessed using logistic regression (product choice tasks) and analysis of variance tests (ratings of unhealthy product and FOPP). Results: Compared with parents who saw a control advertisement, parents who saw a counter-advertisement perceived unhealthy products featuring FOPPs as less healthy, expressed weaker intentions for buying such products, and were more likely to read the nutrition facts panel before nominating choices (all P &lt; .001). Conclusions and Implications: Counter-advertising may help reduce the misleading influence of unhealthy food marketing and improve the accuracy of parents' evaluations of how nutritious promoted food products are.

Using Facebook to deliver a social norm intervention to reduce problem drinking at university,"Introduction and Aims: University students usually overestimate peer alcohol use, resulting in them ‘drinking up’ to perceived norms. Social norms theory suggests correcting these inflated perceptions can reduce alcohol consumption. Recent findings by the current authors show portraying oneself as ‘a drinker’ is considered by many students to be a socially desirable component of their Facebook identity, perpetuating an online culture that normalises binge drinking. However, social networking sites have yet to be utilised in social norms interventions. Design and Methods: Actual and perceived descriptive and injunctive drinking norms were collected from 244 university students. Ninety‐five students screened positive for hazardous drinking and were randomly allocated to a control group or intervention group that received social norms feedback via personalised Facebook private messages over three sessions. Results: At 1 month post‐intervention, the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumed by intervention group during the previous month had significantly reduced compared with baseline and controls. Reductions were maintained 3 months post‐intervention. Intervention group perceived drinking norms were significantly more accurate post‐intervention. Discussion and Conclusions: This is the first study to test the feasibility of using Facebook to deliver social norms interventions. Correcting misperceptions of peer drinking norms resulted in clinically significant reductions in alcohol use. Facebook has many advantages over traditional social norms delivery, providing an innovative method for tackling problem drinking at university. These results have implications for the use of Facebook to deliver positive messages about safe alcohol use to students, which may counter the negative messages regarding alcohol normally seen on Facebook.

Perceived peer drinking norms and responsible drinking in UK university settings,"Background: Heavy drinking is common among students at UK universities. US students overestimate how much their peers drink and correcting this through the use of social norm messages may promote responsible drinking. Objectives: We tested whether there is an association between perceived campus drinking norms and usual drinking behavior in UK university students and whether norm messages about responsible drinking correct normative misperceptions and increase students’ intentions to drink responsibly. Method: 1,020 UK university students took part in an online study. Participants were exposed to one of five message types: a descriptive norm, an injunctive norm, a descriptive and injunctive norm, or one of two control messages. Message credibility was assessed. Afterwards participants completed measures of intentions to drink responsibly and we measured usual drinking habits and perceptions of peer drinking. Results: Perceptions of peer drinking were associated modestly with usual drinking behavior, whereby participants who believed other students drank responsibly also drank responsibly. Norm messages changed normative perceptions, but not in the target population of participants who underestimated responsible drinking in their peers at baseline. Norm messages did not increase intentions to drink responsibly and although based on accurate data, norm messages were not seen as credible. Conclusions: In this UK based study, although perceived social norms about peer drinking were associated with individual differences in drinking habits, campus wide norm messages about responsible drinking did not affect students’ intentions to drink more responsibly. More research is required to determine if this approach can be applied to UK settings.

Web-based screening and brief intervention for student marijuana use in a university health center: Pilot study to examine the implementation of eCHECKUP TO GO in different contexts,"This pilot study sought to test the feasibility of procedures to screen students for marijuana use in Student Health Services (SHS) and test the efficacy of a web-based intervention designed to reduce marijuana use and consequences. Students were asked to participate in voluntary screening of health behaviors upon arrival at SHS. One hundred and twenty-three students who used marijuana at least monthly completed assessments and were randomized to one of four intervention conditions in a 2 (intervention: Marijuana eCHECKUP TO GO vs. control)×2 (site of intervention: on-site vs. off-site) between-groups design. Follow-up assessments were conducted online at 3 and 6 months. Latent growth modeling was used to provide effect size estimates for the influence of intervention on outcomes. One thousand and eighty undergraduate students completed screening. The intervention did not influence marijuana use frequency. However, there was evidence of a small overall intervention effect on marijuana-related consequences and a medium effect in stratified analyses in the on-site condition. Analyses of psychological variables showed that the intervention significantly reduced perceived norms regarding peer marijuana use. These findings demonstrate that it is feasible to identify marijuana users in SHS and deliver an automated web-based intervention to these students in different contexts. Effect size estimates suggest that the intervention has some promise as a means of correcting misperceptions of marijuana use norms and reducing marijuana-related consequences. Future work should test the efficacy of this intervention in a full scale randomized controlled trial.

"Science, pseudoscience, and the frontline practitioner: The vaccination/autism debate","This article demonstrates how misinformation concerning autism and vaccinations was created and suggests that social workers may be perfectly poised to challenge pseudoscience interpretations. Utilizing social network theory, this article illustrates how erroneous research, mass media, and public opinion led to a decreased use of vaccinations in the United States and a seven-fold increase in measles outbreaks. It traces the dissemination of spurious research results and demonstrates how information was transmitted via a system of social network nodes and community ties. This article encourages social workers, as frontline knowledge brokers, to counter misinformation, which may lead to significant public health consequences.

"""Sources of information and behavioral patterns in online health forums: Observational study"": Correction","Reports an error in ""Sources of information and behavioral patterns in online health forums: Observational study"" by Fabian Sudau, Tim Friede, Jens Grabowski, Janka Koschack, Philip Makedonski and Wolfgang Himmel ( Journal of Medical Internet Research , 2014[Jan], Vol 16[1], 220-234). The authors of the paper originally entitled ""Sources of Information and Behavioral Patterns in Online Health Forums: Qualitative Study"" wish to correct the title of their publication. The subtitle ""Qualitative Study"" is misleading because the analysis was primarily quantitative. The title has now been changed to read ""Sources of Information and Behavioral Patterns in Online Health Forums: Observational Study"". (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2014-12211-019). Background: Increasing numbers of patients are raising their voice in online forums. This shift is welcome as an act of patient autonomy, reflected in the term “expert patient”. At the same time, there is considerable concern that patients can be easily misguided by pseudoscientific research and debate. Little is known about the sources of information used in health-related online forums, how users apply this information, and how they behave in such forums. Objective: The intent of the study was to identify (1) the sources of information used in online health-related forums, and (2) the roles and behavior of active forum visitors in introducing and disseminating this information. Methods: This observational study used the largest German multiple sclerosis (MS) online forum as a database, analyzing the user debate about the recently proposed and controversial Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency (CCSVI) hypothesis. After extracting all posts and then filtering relevant CCSVI posts between 01 January 2008 and 17 August 2012, we first identified hyperlinks to scientific publications and other information sources used or referenced in the posts. Employing k-means clustering, we then analyzed the users’ preference for sources of information and their general posting habits. Results: Of 139,912 posts from 11,997 threads, 8628 posts discussed or at least mentioned CCSVI. We detected hyperlinks pointing to CCSVI-related scientific publications in 31 posts. In contrast, 2829 different URLs were posted to the forum, most frequently referring to social media, such as YouTube or Facebook. We identified a total of 6 different roles of hyperlink posters including Social Media Fans, Organization Followers, and Balanced Source Users. Apart from the large and nonspecific residual category of the “average user”, several specific behavior patterns were identified, such as the small but relevant groups of CCSVI-Focused Responders or CCSVI Activators. Conclusions: The bulk of the observed contributions were not based on scientific results, but on various social media sources. These sources seem to contain mostly opinions and personal experience. A small group of people with distinct behavioral patterns played a core role in fuelling the discussion about CCSVI.

"""Cross validation of the b test in a large known groups sample"": Corrigendum","Reports an error in ""Cross validation of the b Test in a large known groups sample"" by Cedria J. Roberson, Kyle Brauer Boone, Hope Goldberg, Deborah Miora, Maria Cottingham, Tara Victor, Elizabeth Ziegler, Michelle Zeller and Matthew Wright ( The Clinical Neuropsychologist , 2013[Apr], Vol 27[3], 495-508). In the original article, Maria Cottingham’s affiliation was listed in error as Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, Camp Pendleton, CA,USA. This has now been corrected in both the print and online versions to Private Practice, USA. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2013-14159-012). The b Test (Boone, Lu, &amp; Herzberg, 2002a) is a measure of cognitive performance validity originally validated on 91 non-credible participants and 7 credible clinical comparison groups (total n = 161). The purpose of the current study was to provide cross-validation data for the b Test on a known groups sample of non-credible participants ( n = 212) and credible heterogeneous neuropsychological clinic patients ( n = 103). The new data showed that while the original E-score cut-off of ≥ 155 achieved excellent specificity (99%), it was associated with relatively poor sensitivity (41%). However, the cut-off could be substantially lowered to ≥ 82, while still maintaining adequate specificity (≥ 90%) and raising sensitivity to 68%. Examination of non-credible subgroups revealed that b Test sensitivity in feigned mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) was 58%, whereas in non-credible patients claiming depression and psychosis, cut-off sensitivity was 76% and 67%, respectively. These data suggest that the b Test may have a particular role in detection of non-credible cognitive symptoms associated with feigned psychiatric symptoms, and that fabricated deficits in processing speed and vigilance/visual scanning, detected by the b Test, are more prominent in feigned psychiatric presentations than in feigned mTBI. Further, b Test failures in patients with somatoform disorders were common, indicating that the b Test may have a specific use in detection of non-consciously created cognitive dysfunction associated with somatoform conditions.

Cross validation of the b Test in a large known groups sample,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 27(4) of The Clinical Neuropsychologist (see record 2013-21627-001). In the original article, Maria Cottingham’s affiliation was listed in error as Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, Camp Pendleton, CA,USA. This has now been corrected in both the print and online versions to Private Practice, USA.] The b Test (Boone, Lu, &amp; Herzberg, 2002a) is a measure of cognitive performance validity originally validated on 91 non-credible participants and 7 credible clinical comparison groups (total n = 161). The purpose of the current study was to provide cross-validation data for the b Test on a known groups sample of non-credible participants ( n = 212) and credible heterogeneous neuropsychological clinic patients ( n = 103). The new data showed that while the original E-score cut-off of ≥ 155 achieved excellent specificity (99%), it was associated with relatively poor sensitivity (41%). However, the cut-off could be substantially lowered to ≥ 82, while still maintaining adequate specificity (≥ 90%) and raising sensitivity to 68%. Examination of non-credible subgroups revealed that b Test sensitivity in feigned mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) was 58%, whereas in non-credible patients claiming depression and psychosis, cut-off sensitivity was 76% and 67%, respectively. These data suggest that the b Test may have a particular role in detection of non-credible cognitive symptoms associated with feigned psychiatric symptoms, and that fabricated deficits in processing speed and vigilance/visual scanning, detected by the b Test, are more prominent in feigned psychiatric presentations than in feigned mTBI. Further, b Test failures in patients with somatoform disorders were common, indicating that the b Test may have a specific use in detection of non-consciously created cognitive dysfunction associated with somatoform conditions.

Digital fabrication as an instructional technology for supporting upper elementary and middle school science and mathematics education,"The purpose of this three-paper manuscript dissertation was to study digital fabrication as an instructional technology for supporting elementary and middle school science and mathematics education. Article one analyzed the effects of digital fabrication activities that were designed to contextualize mathematics education at a summer mathematics enrichment program for upper elementary and middle school students. The primary dependent variables studied were the participants' knowledge of mathematics and science content, attitudes towards STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and STEM-related careers. Based upon the data collected, three results were presented as having justifiable supporting empirical evidence: (1) The digital fabrication activities, combined with the other mathematics activities at the enrichment program, resulted in non-significant overall gains in students' mathematics test scores and attitudes towards STEM. (2) The digital fabrication activities, combined with the other mathematics activities at the enrichment program, resulted in noteworthy gains on the ""Probability &amp; Statistics"" questions. (3) Some students who did poorly on the scored paper test on mathematics and science content were nonetheless nominated by their teachers as demonstrating meritorious distinction during the digital fabrication activities (termed ""Great Thinkers"" by the 5th-grade teachers). Article two focused on how an instructional technology course featuring digital fabrication activities impacted (1) preservice elementary teachers' efficacy beliefs about teaching science, and (2) their attitudes and understanding of how to include instructional technology and digital fabrication activities into teaching science. The research design compared two sections of a teaching with technology course featuring digital fabrication activities to another section of the same course that utilized a media cycle framework (Bull &amp; Bell, 2005) that did not feature digital fabrication activities. Based upon analysis of the data collected, two main results were determined to have justifiable supporting empirical evidence: (1) After the instructional technology course featuring digital fabrication activities, the participants reported statistically significant overall gains in science teaching efficacy beliefs. (2) When asked to describe their future plans for using three instructional technologies in their teaching, the top five most mentioned instructional technologies were: interactive whiteboards, video, class website, interactive online timeline, and digital fabrication. Of the participants that mentioned digital fabrication, the specific content areas mentioned were: history (four out of eight students mentioned), social studies (two out of eight), and science, math, engineering, and technology were each mentioned once. Article three assessed the impact of a series of lessons incorporating a NASA-themed transmedia book featuring digital fabrication activities on 5th-grade students who had been recognized as advanced in mathematics. The main dependent variables studied were the students' knowledge of science content from the Virginia Standards of Learning, attitude towards science, and student reported likes and dislikes about the project. Based upon analysis of the data collected, three main results were presented: (1) Students demonstrated significant positive gains in correct answers to questions on the topic of ""Force, Matter, Energy, &amp; Motion"" from pretest to posttest. (2) There were nonsignificant gains reported by students on the attitude survey questions about attitude towards science, but this was chiefly because of one question that was significantly impacted in a negative direction.

Brief online interventions targeting risk and protective factors for increased and problematic alcohol use among American college students studying abroad,"Research documents increased and problematic alcohol use during study abroad experiences for college students. In addition, study abroad students may be a self-selecting subgroup of students who drink at greater rates and experience more consequences than non-study abroad students both prior to and after trips. Despite increasing numbers of students studying abroad each year and growing concerns about this high-risk event, there is limited research available documenting efficacious preventive programs with these students. Previous work suggests perceptions of study abroad peer drinking and host country native adult drinking are risk factors for increased alcohol use while abroad, while components related to positive Sojourner Adjustment (i.e., the process of positive and healthy adjustment among individuals establishing temporary residencies in new cultures) may protect against problematic use. Employing a 2 x 2 longitudinal randomized intervention design with an assessment only control condition, the present study sought to prevent increased and problematic alcohol use by correcting misperceptions of study abroad student and host country native drinking norms and by promoting positive and healthy adjustment into the host culture through brief online personalized feedback interventions. A sample of 343 study abroad students were randomly assigned to one of four conditions including a personalized normative feedback intervention (PNF) only, a Sojourner Adjustment feedback intervention (SAF), a combined PNF + SAF intervention, and an assessment only control condition. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that, contrary to hypotheses, participants in the SAF intervention condition increased their drinking during the first month abroad compared to control. This effect was mediated by decreases in perceived abstinence rates. In contrast, SAF and PNF participants reported reduced alcohol-related consequences compared to control participants during the last month abroad. Participants who studied in Europe and who reported higher pre-departure social reasons for drinking appeared to benefit most from the PNF intervention during the last month abroad. The interventions including SAF content appeared to work best for participants with higher coping reasons for drinking. This research represents an important first step in designing and implementing efficacious interventions with at-risk study abroad college students using online methodologies with normative information and Sojourner Adjustment content.

Drinking norms: Predictors of misperceptions among college students,"Objectives: To explore misperceptions and predictors of misperceptions of celebration and general drinking norms. Participants were traditional college students (N = 214). Methods: An online questionnaire was developed to assess personal drinking behavior and perceived drinking norms. Results: Significant misperceptions exist among students regarding their perception of the drinking patterns and behaviors displayed by peers in general and during celebration events. Overestimation is more prevalent for celebration drinking than for drinking in general. The odds of being an overestimator are greater for out-of-state residents, frequent drinkers, and students with lower GPAs. Conclusions: Effective strategies should be implemented to correct misperceptions.

Neuromyths in education: Prevalence and predictors of misconceptions among teachers,"The OECD’s Brain and Learning project (2002) emphasized that many misconceptions about the brain exist among professionals in the field of education. Though these so-called “neuromyths” are loosely based on scientific facts, they may have adverse effects on educational practice. The present study investigated the prevalence and predictors of neuromyths among teachers in selected regions in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. A large observational survey design was used to assess general knowledge of the brain and neuromyths. The sample comprised 242 primary and secondary school teachers who were interested in the neuroscience of learning. It would be of concern if neuromyths were found in this sample, as these teachers may want to use these incorrect interpretations of neuroscience findings in their teaching practice. Participants completed an online survey containing 32 statements about the brain and its influence on learning, of which 15 were neuromyths. Additional data was collected regarding background variables (e.g., age, sex, school type). Results showed that on average, teachers believed 49% of the neuromyths, particularly myths related to commercialized educational programs. Around 70% of the general knowledge statements were answered correctly. Teachers who read popular science magazines achieved higher scores on general knowledge questions. More general knowledge also predicted an increased belief in neuromyths. These findings suggest that teachers who are enthusiastic about the possible application of neuroscience findings in the classroom find it difficult to distinguish pseudoscience from scientific facts. Possessing greater general knowledge about the brain does not appear to protect teachers from believing in neuromyths. This demonstrates the need for enhanced interdisciplinary communication to reduce such misunderstandings in the future and establish a successful collaboration between neuroscience and education.

Personalised normative feedback for preventing alcohol misuse in university students: Solomon three-group randomised controlled trial,"Background: Young people tend to over-estimate peer group drinking levels. Personalised normative feedback (PNF) aims to correct this misperception by providing information about personal drinking levels and patterns compared with norms in similar aged peer groups. PNF is intended to raise motivation for behaviour change and has been highlighted for alcohol misuse prevention by the British Government Behavioural Insight Team. The objective of the trial was to assess the effectiveness of PNF with college students for the prevention of alcohol misuse. Methodology: Solomon three-group randomised controlled trial. 1751 students, from 22 British Universities, allocated to a PNF group, a normal control group, or a delayed measurement control group to allow assessment of any measurement effects. PNF was provided by email. Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline, 6- and 12-months (only 12- months for the delayed measurement controls). Drinking behaviour measures were (i) alcohol disorders; (ii) frequency; (iii) typical quantity, (iv) weekly consumption; (v) alcohol-related problems; (vi) perceived drinking norms; and (vii) positive alcohol expectancies. Analyses focused on high-risk drinkers, as well as all students, because of research evidence for the prevention paradox in student drinkers. Principal Findings: Follow-up rates were low, with only 50% and 40% responding at 6- and 12-months, respectively, though comparable to similar European studies. We found no evidence for any systematic attrition bias. Overall, statistical analyses with the high risk sub-sample, and for all students, showed no significant effects of the intervention, at either time-point, in a completed case analysis and a multiple imputation analysis. Conclusions: We found no evidence for the effectiveness of PNF for the prevention of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems in a UK student population.

Missteps on the road to scientific utopia,"Comments on an article by Brian A. Nosek &amp; Yoav Bar-Anan (see record 2012-24018-001). Nosek and Bar-Anan's proposals perform a service for psychology because they make us think of what is wrong and what is right about the way we do things. Nosek &amp; Bar-Anan make us see where scientific dissemination has been and where it must go. Nosek and Bar-Anan are absolutely correct that we must move into the digital age. The production costs of what can be produced profitably for publishers have traditionally been a limitation on the quantity and rapidity of disseminating science. I applaud Nosek and Bar-Anan's advocating a shift in production from traditional print to electronic internet, from Guttenberg to Steve Jobs so to speak, but the truth is that we are already there. The problem with Nosek and Bar-Anan’s analysis of the monetary motive is that it conflates profit with whether fees are collected from authors or users. Nosek and Bar-Anan’s open versus closed platform is misleading. The most interesting and innovative change that Nosek and Bar-Anan suggest is the separation of publication from review.

PGDnet: A new problem‐solving virtual learning environment,"The purpose of this paper was to provide information about the virtual learning environment known as PGDnet (the Spanish acronym for Plataforma de Gestión Docente or Educational Management Platform in English), which was developed by the innovative education group at the Technical University of Madrid known as “ Nuevas metodologías docentes en ingeniería mecánica y fabricación ” (New Teaching Methodologies in Mechanical Engineering and Manufacturing). This tool has been created on an ad hoc basis to cover specific teaching requirements for some engineering courses, which would be difficult to implement on general educational platforms such as Moodle or Blackboard. PGDnet was essentially created as an online engineering problem‐solving tool. These exercises are checked and corrected automatically, providing students with their final and partial scores, and with the solutions to these various sections. A stochastic programming model selects different exercises each time that an activity is performed and attaches the tables, graphs, figures and annexes that are needed for their resolution in each case. As is common with these types of tools, PGDnet provides effective management of publication and delivery dates for the proposed work, and contains records and databases, which allow the stored information to be processed. Its main features include ease of use, reliability and great versatility as a specific tool in the area of technical university education.

The potential influence of internet-based social networking on the conduct of clinical research studies,"The rapid growth of internet usage has led to an explosion of social networking sites for discussion of health issues. This provides a forum for subjects to communicate with one another during the course of the studies. Previous studies have raised concerns about the quality of health information on social networking sites, although none have evaluated content related to ongoing clinical trials. We reviewed material posted in virtual communities by self-identified clinical trial participants. We identified material posted in online health forums that could introduce bias into clinical research studies; we believe that this issue warrants further study and discussion. Physicians and others who conduct clinical trials should be aware of this issue. Study investigators and research teams should also talk to their study subjects about where and how they are obtaining information in order to prevent behaviors and correct misinformation that could put a subject’s safety or the study objectives at risk. Given the rapid increase in Internet use for health care, a broader evaluation of both the benefits and potential risks of social networking among research participants during the course of a clinical trial appears warranted.

Young people’s perceptions of cigarette packaging and plain packaging: An online survey,"[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 14(4) of Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research (see record 2012-09903-017). In the original article, Funding section should read as follows: HS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde, Cancer Research UK and UK Center for Tobacco Control Studies. Funding to UKCTCS from the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK, the Economic and Social Research Council, the Medical Research Council and the National Institute of Health Research, under the auspices of the UK Clinical Research Collaboration, is gratefully acknowledged.] Introduction: In the United Kingdom, with most marketing channels prohibited, packaging is one of the few remaining ways that tobacco companies can promote their products. Methods: An online survey with young people aged 10–17 years (N = 658) was used to explore why youth choose cigarettes, perceptions of pack color, and perceptions of plain (nonbranded) cigarette packaging. Young people were also shown an image of 3 plain packs, which differed by shape and method of opening, and asked which they liked most and thought others their age would smoke. Results: Price and what significant others smoke were key factors for choosing cigarettes, with packaging also an important influence. More than a third of the sample associated lighter pack color with weak tasting and less harmful cigarettes. Plain packs were rated negatively as were perceptions of plain pack users. One in 3 showed a preference for either a narrow ""perfume type"" plain pack or a plain ""slide"" pack that opened from the side, and 1 in 3 also thought that young people would smoke these packs. Conclusions: Packaging appears to both attract young people and mislead them about product strength and relative harm. Innovative pack construction (novel pack shape and method of opening) and the use of color are instrumental in these effects. The findings therefore suggest that any move to plain packaging should not only consider the benefits of removing branding (including color) but also of standardizing pack construction in terms of shape and method of opening.

Movement disorders on YouTube―Caveat spectator,"We were recently alerted by our patients to content regarding movement disorders that is available on YouTube (www.youtube.com), the third most visited Web site. A brief search revealed that many of the videos seemed to us to be atypical for the specific form of movement disorder the person in the video was purported to have. In fact, some of the videos showed movements characteristic of psychogenic movement disorders, the movement-disorder counterpart of conversion disorder. We therefore asked seven neurologists who were experts in movement disorders to independently evaluate the most frequently viewed YouTube videos of patients purported to have a movement disorder and to judge whether the movement disorder depicted appeared to be psychogenic or organic. We asked the raters to base their judgments on published diagnostic criteria for psychogenic movement disorders that are related to aspects of the movement disorder apparent on simple observation. For patients with a movement disorder, the information available on YouTube may be misleading and may provide an inaccurate impression of the disorder and its treatment. The fact that such a large number of videos showing psychogenic movement disorders are available on the Internet highlights an underlying problem that affects virtually every medical specialty, and the information these videos provide can interfere with the effective recognition and care of patients with a movement disorder.

Providing accurate safety information may increase a smoker's willingness to use nicotine replacement therapy as part of a quit attempt,"Aim: Previous studies have reported that smokers who are misinformed about the safety of Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) are less likely to report using it. In this study, we examined whether providing information that counters these concerns might impact on intentions to use NRT. Participants: 900 smokers recruited from a market research database. Design and setting: Participants completed an online survey that asked about their views about NRT. Smokers with safety and efficacy concerns were queried to determine whether accurate information might increase their interest in using NRT. Findings: Misperceptions of NRT safety were common: 93% of smokers did not know that smoking while wearing the nicotine patch does not cause heart attacks; 76% that nicotine gum/lozenge are not as addictive as cigarettes; and 69% that NRT products are not as dangerous as cigarettes. Over half of the smokers with misperceptions reported that they would be more likely to use NRT to help them quit smoking if they were exposed to information correcting their concerns (53%, 58% and 66%, respectively, for each of the misperceptions). Conclusions: These data suggest that while a sizeable proportion of smokers are still misinformed about the safety of NRT, misinformed smokers would increase consideration of NRT if these misperceptions are addressed by corrective information.

Scientific literacy and the media,"Topics covered in Neuroskeptic range from harsh reviews of the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of neuroleptics; risks of antidepressant medications in adolescents; misleading medical advertising; biased presentation of clinical trial data; the fallacies of some fMRI studies (our favorite was a study of BOLD signal in dead salmon); running accounts of high-profile cases of alleged misconduct [recently that of Harvard's Marc Hauser (no relation)]; and the problem of ghostwriting. Neuroskeptic is irreverent, sometimes profane, and can skirt the boundaries of good taste. Nonetheless, Neuroskeptic covers a rich mixture mixture of important, engaging, or amusing topics focusing on the basic and clinical neurosciences, and does so in a data-driven, user-friendly, and comment-enabled format. Neuroskeptic is only one of a number of increasingly used web sites and blogs dedicated to promoting public education, rational discourse, and a healthy dose of skepticism around important issues in the neurosciences. We share these goals at the Annals , and have tried to implement policies that minimize publication of faulty data, promote a cautious interpretation of scientific findings, and correct errors in the existing literature.

An assessment of risk behaviours for HIV/AIDS among young female garment workers in Bangladesh,"[Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 21(3) of International Journal of STD &amp; AIDS (see record 2010-06953-010). The original article contained numerous errors when it was first published online on 21 January 2010. These errors were grammatical and included listing two authors rather than just one author. The corrected version was republished online on 18 February 2010.] This study attempted to assess the risk behaviours for HIV/AIDS among female garment workers aged 15–24 years. A total of 300 garment workers in Dhaka city were assessed with a semi-structured interview. Their knowledge of HIV/AIDS was moderate with high rates of misperception regarding modes of transmission. Further, symptoms of possible sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as genital ulcer disease and vaginal discharge were prevalent, and risk behaviours such as low use of condoms, multiple sex partners and drug abuse were also found. Logistic regression identified that women who sourced information through radio/television, health service providers or friends had higher age at first intercourse and higher HIV/AIDS knowledge scores and were more likely to use condoms. Those who gained information through radio/televison or health service providers and those who abused drugs were more likely to have sex with multiple sex partners, while information gained through health service providers, and higher HIV/AIDS knowledge were protective against drug abuse, whereas sex with multiple partners was a predictor of drug abuse. We conclude that in Bangladesh, female garment workers are at risk of HIV/AIDS due to low education, lack of knowledge, STIs and risky behaviour.
