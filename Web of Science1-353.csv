Two experimental studies were conducted. In study 1, correction mechanisms explicitly endorsed the message corrective (n = 235). As an explicit endorsement may reveal persuasive intent and influence narrative persuasion, Study 2 replicated the design and employed a manipulation for correction mechanism with a more implicit endorsement (n = 235). Findings generally suggest that nonnarrative correction is more effective when it is suggested by social media contacts; narrative correction may have merit when it is prompted by algorithms with explicit endorsement. Credibility evaluations and narrative transportation highlight the psychological mechanisms for understanding this interaction effect.","[Huang, Yan] Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, 3347 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Wang, Weirui] Florida Int Univ, Dept Commun, Miami, FL 33199 USA","Huang, Y (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, 3347 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",yhuang63@uh.edu,,,Arthur W.

Design/methodology/approach The partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used for the analysis. Data were drawn from 152 Facebook and WhatsApp users in Nigeria to examine the research model formulated using the uses and gratification theory (UGT). Findings We found that altruism, instant news sharing, socialisation and self-promotion predicted fake news sharing related to COVID-19 pandemic among social media users in Nigeria. Specifically, altruism was the strongest predictor to fake news sharing behaviour related to COVID-19, followed by instant news sharing and socialisation. On the contrary, entertainment had no association with fake news sharing on COVID-19. Practical implications We suggest intervention strategies which nudge people to be sceptical of the information they come across on social media. We also recommend healthcare providers and the Nigerian government to provide relevant information on this current pandemic. That is, correct information should be shared widely to the public domain through various conventional and online media. This will lessen the spread of fake news on the concocted cure and prevention tips found online. Originality/value The salient contributions of this study are as follows: First, it brings to the fore that the desire for self-promotion is associated with fake news sharing on social media; second, it shifts the focus of studies on fake news from detection methods to sharing behaviour, which fuels the uncontrollable spread of falsehood; third, it expands the existing literature on misinformation sharing by demonstrating the user motivation that leads to fake news sharing using the UGT.","[Apuke, Oberiri Destiny; Omar, Bahiyah] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Commun, Pulau Penang, Malaysia; [Apuke, Oberiri Destiny] Taraba State Univ, Dept Mass Commun, Jalingo, Nigeria","Apuke, OD (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Commun, Pulau Penang, Malaysia.; Apuke, OD (corresponding author), Taraba State Univ, Dept Mass Commun, Jalingo, Nigeria.",apultedestiny@gmail.com,,,"Universiti Sains Malaysia, Research University (RU) GrantUniversiti Sains Malaysia [1001/PCOMM/8016112]","The authors acknowledge the support received from the Universiti Sains Malaysia, Research University (RU) Grant (1001/PCOMM/8016112).",,69,0,0,7,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1468-4527,1468-4535,,ONLINE INFORM REV,Online Inf.

Objective: We aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation exposure and beliefs, associated factors including psychological distress with misinformation exposure, and the associations between COVID-19 knowledge and number of preventive behaviors. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 1049 South Korean adults in April 2020. Respondents were asked about receiving COVID-19 misinformation using 12 items identified by the World Health Organization. Logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for the association of receiving misinformation with sociodemographic characteristics, source of information, COVID-19 misinformation belief, and psychological distress, as well as the associations of COVID-19 misinformation belief with COVID-19 knowledge and the number of COVID-19 preventive behaviors among those who received the misinformation. All data were weighted according to the Korea census data in 2018. Results: Overall, 67.78% (n=711) of respondents reported exposure to at least one COVID-19 misinformation item. Misinformation exposure was associated with younger age, higher education levels, and lower income. Sources of information associated with misinformation exposure were social networking services (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.20-2.32) and instant messaging (aOR 1.79, 1.27-2.51). Misinformation exposure was also associated with psychological distress including anxiety (aOR 1.80, 1.24-2.61), depressive (aOR 1.47, 1.09-2.00), and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (aOR 1.97, 1.42-2.73), as well as misinformation belief (aOR 7.33, 5.17-10.38). Misinformation belief was associated with poorer COVID-19 knowledge (high: aOR 0.62, 0.45-0.84) and fewer preventive behaviors (>= 7 behaviors: aOR 0.54, 0.39-0.74). Conclusions: COVID-19 misinformation exposure was associated with misinformation belief, while misinformation belief was associated with fewer preventive behaviors. Given the potential of misinformation to undermine global efforts in COVID-19 disease control, up-to-date public health strategies are required to counter the proliferation of misinformation.","[Lee, Jung Jae; Wang, Man Ping; Zhao, Sheng Zhi; Wong, Janet Yuen Ha] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Nursing, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Kang, Kyung-Ah; Shin, Sunhwa] Sahmyook Univ, Coll Nursing, 815 Hwarang Ro, Seoul 01795, South Korea; [O'Connor, Siobhan] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Hlth Social Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Yang, Sook Ching] Univ Aberdeen, Sch Med Med Sci & Nutr, Aberdeen, Scotland","Shin, S (corresponding author), Sahmyook Univ, Coll Nursing, 815 Hwarang Ro, Seoul 01795, South Korea.",shinsh@syu.ac.kr,"; O'Connor, Siobhan/D-8140-2015; Wong, Janet Yuen Ha/F-4433-2011","Shin, Sunhwa/0000-0003-4052-9542; Lee, Jung Jae/0000-0001-9704-2116; Wang, Man Ping/0000-0003-4000-2388; O'Connor, Siobhan/0000-0001-8579-1718; Wong, Janet Yuen Ha/0000-0002-3000-4577",,,,50,0,0,0,0,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

Nor was there a study exploring the experience of patients in their breast cancer journey.MethodsA qualitative interview study with thematic analysis, conducted with 36 patients.ResultsThere is no clear pattern of presentation for breast cancer by cancer stage at diagnosis, age and ethnicity in the cancer journey of this group of patients. Patients were diagnosed with early to advanced stages cancer regardless of when they presented or took up treatment in their cancer journey. The reasons patients sought medical attention also did not appear to differ between the stages of cancer diagnosed, ethnic and age. Without setting a measure to define early and late presentation, we found that women shared similar experience in their breast cancer journey, regardless of age, ethnicity and stage of cancer at diagnosis. Poor knowledge of breast cancer (symptoms and causes); few practised regular BSE; denial of symptom; fear of hospitalisation, diagnosis and treatment; worries and stress over financial burden of treatment; misinformation in magazine and online sources; diet; stress; caring responsibility; support network; and use of alternative medicine before and after diagnosis were identified in patients' narratives. Strong social support; fear of being an emotional and financial burden for the family; and financial worries during treatment were also the recurring themes after diagnosis.ConclusionA measure of breast cancer presentation - that accounts for the patient's experience in the cancer journey, the time interval and tumour biology - that is meaningful to patients, clinicians and researchers is needed. For research on late and delayed presentation, details on BSE practice - how often, when and was it done correctly - will improve the accuracy of time delay interval. For the public, concerted efforts to improve knowledge of breast cancer, survival and prognosis for early-diagnosed cancer, and the importance of regular and correct technique to perform BSE, are critical and urgent to address the rising breast cancer incidence in the country.","[Ng, Celene W.

Facebook, being the biggest social media platform, plays a significant role in the spread of information influencing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care agencies like the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) use social media as a platform to impart information regarding COVID-19; simultaneously, there is a spread of misinformation on social media, masking the credible sources of information. Our research aims to assess the utility of Facebook in providing misinformation and testing its fact-check policy. Methods An online search was conducted on Facebook by a newly created account to eliminate bias. The Facebook search bar was used to investigate multiple keywords. Data were tabulated in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Descriptive statistical analysis of Facebook accounts and posts was done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) while statistical importance was set a priority at a p- value of 0.05. Results Our study consisted of 454 Facebook posts. Most (22.5%) were posted by verified accounts and 23.9% by informal individual/group accounts. The tone for most (40.4%) COVID-19 information was serious while the most common (43.9%) topic was medical/public health. In total, 22.3% included misinformation, 19.6% were unverifiable, and 27.5% included correct information verifiable by the WHO or CDC. Conclusions Misinformation/unverifiable information related to the COVID-19 crisis is spreading at a distressing rate on social media. We quantified the misinformation and tested Facebook's fact-check policy. We advise strict initiatives to control this infodemic and advise future researches to evaluate the accuracy of content being circulated on other social media platforms.","[Ahmed, Naseem] Dow Univ Hlth Sci DUHS, Pathol, Karachi, Pakistan; [Shahbaz, Tooba; Shamim, Asma; Usman, Asad] Dow Univ Hlth Sci DUHS, Med, Karachi, Pakistan; [Khan, Kiran Shafiq; Hussain, S.

The lessons learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak indicate that knowledge and attitudes about infectious diseases are related to panic among the population, which may further complicate efforts to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Misunderstandings may result in behaviors such as underestimation, panic, and taking ineffective measures to avoid infection; these behaviors are likely to cause the epidemic to spread further. Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess public health perceptions and misunderstandings about COVID-19 in China, and to propose targeted response measures based on the findings to control the development of the epidemic. Methods: The study was conducted in April 2020 through an online survey, with participants in 8 provinces in Eastern, Central, and Western China. We designed a questionnaire with a health knowledge section consisting of 5 questions (4 conventional questions and 1 misleading question) on clinical features of and preventive measures against COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square analysis, binary logistic regression, and Mantel-Haenszel hierarchical analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results: In total, 4788 participants completed the survey and the mean knowledge score was 4.63 (SD 0.67), gained mainly through experts (76.1%), television (60.0%), newspapers (57.9%), and opinions (46.6%) and videos (42.9%) from social media. Compared to those who obtained information from only 1 or 2 channels, people who obtained information from >3 channels had increased health perception and a better ability to identify misleading information. Suggestions from experts were the most positive information source (chi(2)=41.61), while information on social media was the most misleading. Those aged >60 years (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.10-2.11), those with a lower or middle income (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.00-1.83), those not working and not able to work (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.04-3.21), those with a household income <100,000 RMB (<US $14,954; OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.08-1.67), and those with >2 suspected symptoms (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.50-5.80) were more likely to be misled by videos on social media, but the error correction effect of expert advice was limited in these groups. Conclusions: Multiple information channels can improve public health perception and the identification of misleading information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Videos on social media increased the risk of rumor propagation among vulnerable groups. We suggest the government should strengthen social media regulation and increase experts' influence on the targeted vulnerable populations to reduce the risk of rumors spreading.","[Zhou, Jiawei; Wang, Ruoxi; Feng, Zhanchun; Tang, Shangfeng] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Sch Med & Hlth Management, 13 Hangkong Rd, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Ghose, Bishwajit; Huang, Rui; Feng, Da] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Sch Pharm, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ruijun; Li, Zhifei] China Natl Ctr Biotechnol Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China","Tang, SF (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Sch Med & Hlth Management, 13 Hangkong Rd, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",sftang2018@hust.edu.cn,"Wang, Ruoxi/U-8016-2017","Wang, Ruoxi/0000-0002-9695-0582; zhou, jiawei/0000-0002-8476-0933","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2020kfyXGYJ071, 2020kfyXGYJ013]","ST received funding from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant number 2020kfyXGYJ071&2020kfyXGYJ013).

Vaccine-promoting organisations are working to curb its influence, but face obstacles. We aimed to analyse their social media strategies and the challenges they encounter. Methods In this qualitative study, we purposively sampled 21 participants responsible for social media from vaccine-promoting organisations. We used Framework Analysis to explore the data. Results Vaccine-promoting organisations faced obstacles using social media, including fast-paced change, limited resources, and insufficient organisational buy-in. They experienced difficulties reaching audiences, exploiting social media listening, and measuring impact. Consequently, they may miss opportunities to counter misinformation, connect with groups low in vaccine confidence, and determine diverse audience responses. They lack strong evidence linking social media strategies with behaviour change, and have difficulty understanding silent audiences. Conclusions Vaccine-promoting organisations have an opportunity to embrace the participatory nature of social media. They could share listening insights with like-minded groups, and conduct research exploring associations between social media strategies and community attitude/behaviour change. Social media platforms could assist by renewing vaccine-promoting organisations' organic reach, supporting the development of tailored listening and credibility tools, and strengthening collaborations to promote credible content.","[Steffens, Maryke S.] Macquarie Univ, Australian Inst Hlth Innovat, Ctr Hlth Informat, 75 Talavera Rd, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Dunn, Adam G.] Univ Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Discipline Biomed Informat & Digital Hlth, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Dunn, Adam G.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Computat Hlth Informat Program, Boston, MA USA; [Leask, Julie; Wiley, Kerrie E.] Univ Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Leask, Julie] Univ Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Susan Wakil Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Steffens, MS (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Australian Inst Hlth Innovat, Ctr Hlth Informat, 75 Talavera Rd, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",maryke.steffens@hdr.mq.edu.au,,,Macquarie University Research Training Program Scholarship [2017438]; National Health & Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1128968],"This work was supported by Macquarie University Research Training Program Scholarship No. 2017438 and National Health & Medical Research Council Project Grant APP1128968.

A national survey,CONTRACEPTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Abortion; TRAP laws; Abortion myths; Access to abortion; Reproductive health; Reproductive rights,UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; LAWS; INFORMATION; SAFETY; IMPACT,"Objectives: States vary significantly in their regulation of abortion. Misinformation about abortion is pervasive and propagated by state-mandated scripts that contain abortion myths. We sought to investigate women's knowledge of abortion laws in their state. Our secondary objective was to describe women's ability to discern myths about abortion from facts about abortion. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study of English- and Spanish-speaking women aged 18-49 in the United States. We enrolled members of the GfK KnowledgePanel, a probability-based, nationally-representative online sample. Our primary outcome was the proportion of correct answers to 12 questions about laws regulating abortion in a respondent's state. We asked five questions about common abortion myths. We used descriptive statistics to characterize performance on these measures and bivariate and multivariate modeling to identify risk factors for poor knowledge of state abortion laws. Results: Of 2223 women contacted, 1057 (48%) completed the survey. The mean proportion of correct answers to 12 law questions was 18% (95% CI 17-20%). For three of five assessed myths, women endorsed myths about abortion over facts. Those who believe abortion should be illegal (aOR 2.18, CI 1.40-3.37), and those living in states with neutral or hostile state policies toward abortion (neutral aOR 1.99, CI 1.34-2.97; hostile aOR 1.6, CI 1.07-2.36) were at increased odds of poor law knowledge. Conclusions: Women had low levels of knowledge about state abortion laws and commonly endorse abortion myths. Women's knowledge of their state's abortion laws was associated with personal views about abortion and their state policy environment. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

We herein introduce an integration of digital image processing with a model PAD for easing and improving the signal readout procedure. The colorimetric detection mechanism of PAD relies on in-situ induced yellowish silver nanoparticles via the interaction of silver ions, poly(vinyl alcohol), and ammonia with isoniazid. The observed color value is related with the concentration of isoniazid. The proposed algorithm is based on mathematical morphology recognition, and minimizes the errors arising from manual area selection. Besides, it allows the recognition of both circle and square shapes in 96-well plate and A4 size array designs. Since this algorithm automatically provides the blank-corrected numerical matrixes and image profiles of red, green and blue channels, further investigations such as outlier classification, construction of regression/prediction models and calculation of detection limit can be easily performed. Comparison of signal readout results of the developed algorithm with ImageJ software demonstrates significant improvements in analysis speed, reproducibility, accuracy and color values. Therefore, application of the proposed algorithm is promising as a robust technique for practical applications.","[Hamedpour, Vahid; Minami, Tsuyoshi] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538505, Japan; [Oliveri, Paolo; Malegori, Cristina] Univ Genoa, Dept Pharm, Viale Cembrano 4, I-16148 Genoa, Italy","Hamedpour, V (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538505, Japan.; Oliveri, P (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, Dept Pharm, Viale Cembrano 4, I-16148 Genoa, Italy.",vahid_hamedpour@keio.jp; oliveri@difar.unige.it,"Minami, Tsuyoshi/D-5751-2011; Hamedpour, Vahid/AAP-4071-2020; Malegori, Cristina/W-1298-2017; Oliveri, Paolo/K-4359-2015","Minami, Tsuyoshi/0000-0001-8331-378X; Hamedpour, Vahid/0000-0001-6027-7915; Malegori, Cristina/0000-0002-1760-8915; Oliveri, Paolo/0000-0002-3722-9461",,,,54,0,0,8,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",,0925-4005,,SENSOR ACTUAT B-CHEM,Sens.

Traditionally, public service announcements (PSAs) consisted of video or radio messages, posters, or billboards created by government agencies and health organizations to provide information about health topics. However, the widespread use of the internet and the growth of social media has changed PSA creation and dissemination in many ways. Increasingly, a variety of actors, including non-official sources and lay persons, have been using social media to disseminate PSAs or PSA-like content. Audiences are larger and more engaged with content, and users have the novel ability to interact with PSAs through shares, likes, or comments. While social media for health communication has many advantages, there are also a number of disadvantages including misinformation, conspiracy theories, bots, and trolls. Credibility of different sources has also become a topic of debate. An ongoing challenge during the pandemic has been reaching audiences in a crowded online environment, establishing authority as a trusted source, and countering misinformation. In this paper, we discuss how the media landscape is changing PSAs and the implications of these changes in the context of pandemics.","[Manganello, Jennifer; Schumacher, Patrick] SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy Management & Behav, Albany, NY 12222 USA; [Bleakley, Amy] Univ Delaware, Dept Commun, Newark, DE 19716 USA","Manganello, J (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, One Univ Pl 165, Rensselaer, NY 12144 USA.",jmanganello@albany.edu,,"Manganello, Jennifer/0000-0002-4132-7283",,,,22,0,0,10,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1041-0236,1532-7027,,HEALTH COMMUN,Health Commun.,DEC 5,2020,35,14,,,,,1711,1714,,10.1080/10410236.2020.1839192,,OCT 2020,4,Communication; Health Policy & Services,Communication; Health Care Sciences & Services,OU6GS,WOS:000582546500001,33106041,Bronze,,,2020-12-18,

Communication strategies to address misinformation including fact-checking and warning labels have shown conflicting effects. This study examined how short-term exposure to vaccine misinformation impacted vaccination attitude through both cognitive and affective routes and tested whether and how two-sided refutational messages could negate the misinformation's impact. We conducted an online experiment involving a convenient sample of 609 U.S. adult participants with five message conditions: two misinformation messages (one using the conspiracy frame and one using the uncertainty frame), two corresponding two-sided refutational messages, and a control group. Results showed that both conspiracy and uncertainty framed misinformation messages decreased pro-vaccination attitude in comparison to the control. The two refutational messages increased pro-vaccination attitude in comparison to the corresponding misinformation messages. These effects were further mediated by the emotion of anger. Parental status and conspiracy beliefs did not moderate effects of the messages on vaccination attitude. Our findings indicate two-sided refutational messages can be a promising strategy to combat vaccine misinformation.","[Featherstone, Jieyu Ding; Zhang, Jingwen] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Featherstone, JYD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",jdfeath8@gmail.com,,"Zhang, Jingwen/0000-0003-1733-6857",,,,60,0,0,3,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1081-0730,1087-0415,,J HEALTH COMMUN,J.

The model was tested using data from a web survey of 599 vaccination supporters in the United States. The vaccine supporters reported greater support for government regulation of misinformation when they perceived greater susceptibility among the general public to the influence of misinformation. Surprisingly, the perceived severity of the influence was inversely related to respondents' intention to correct misinformation. In addition, perceived susceptibility to the influence of anti-vaccine misinformation and perceived severity of its influence on others induced negative emotions that included anticipated guilt and anger. The negative emotions in turn motivate vaccine supporters to attitudinally support government's media restriction or behaviorally correct the online misinformation.","[Sun, Yanqing; Chia, Stella C.; Lu, Fangcao; Oktavianus, Jeffry] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Sun, YQ (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",yqsun6-c@my.cityu.edu.hk,,"LU, Fangcao/0000-0003-4479-1177; SUN, Yanqing/0000-0002-3022-369X; Chia, Stella/0000-0003-1632-3464; OKTAVIANUS, Jeffry/0000-0002-0304-9614",City University of Hong KongCity University of Hong Kong [SRG7004935]; Public Policy Research Funding Scheme (2020) [A1.093.20A]; Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office of the Government of the HKSAR,This study is supported by a grant from the City University of Hong Kong (SRG7004935) and the Public Policy Research Funding Scheme (2020.

Using the entrepreneurial marketing (EM) perspective of co-creation of value, this paper aims to explore the manner in which consumers of political communications in a specific region have created user generated value via setting up Facebook forums to manage the risk created by fake news and the trust deficit between citizens and mainstream media (MSM). Design/methodology/approach The paper adopts a netnographic approach to investigation and the data is analysed manual coding (Kozinets, 2015). Facebook groups form the virtual research field in in the context of this study. This approach is adopted because in a social media environment, netnography capitalises over a growing virtual and online communities and allows researchers to study the richness of these online communities (Mkono and Markwell, 2014). Findings The study provides insights on how administrators and moderators of Facebook groups create value for other users by identifying and communicating the risks emerging from social media-based political communication. The study finds that such citizen-led initiatives act as online social aggregators. The value that such groups offer its users/members resides within a well-bound, controlled and moderated online medium that encourages users to counter fake news and misinformation - thereby solving a key problem within the user market i.e. citizen-media trust deficit. Research limitations/implications The study uses a qualitative, netnographic approach and the emerging insights cannot be generalised. The emergent findings are specific to the context of this study and researchers are encouraged to further test the propositions emerging from this research in varied contexts. Practical implications The study extends the application of EM in political contexts using the seven dimensions of EM, which will provide impetus for future political campaigns in terms of unique value creation for publics. The paper also emerges with the role citizen-initiated forums can play in the effective dissemination of digital political communication as user generated content is aiding political debate. Social implications The study helps highlight the role Facebook forums can play in informing the political discourse within a region. The general distrust amongst the citizens over information produced by MSM has meant vocal critics have taken to Facebook to provide their subjective opinions. Although the findings of this study show that such forums can help identify fake news and help citizens discuss and debate the truth, it can also become an avenue to manage propaganda amongst the unaware citizens. This paper flags up the issues and benefits of using Facebook forums and in conclusion relates them to similar occurrences of the past to make society aware of the pitfalls of managed propaganda. Originality/value The paper takes initiative in investigating the use of social media in politics from the citizens' perspective, which is comparatively marginalised against the number of studies taking place, which investigate the political party end use of social media for political marketing.","[Amoncar, Nihar] Univ Derby, Coll Business Law & Social Sci, Derby, England","Amoncar, N (corresponding author), Univ Derby, Coll Business Law & Social Sci, Derby, England.",n.amoncar@derby.ac.uk,,,,,,47,0,0,6,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1471-5201,1471-521X,,J RES MARK ENTREP,J.

Eleven years after its retraction, the paper continues to be cited positively and uncritically to support a medical nutrition intervention, without mention of its 2008 retraction for falsifying data. To date no high quality clinical trials reporting on the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids on reducing inflammatory markers have been published. Our paper uses network analysis, citation context analysis, and retraction status visibility analysis to illustrate the potential for extended propagation of misinformation over a citation network, updating and extending a case study of the first 6 years of post-retraction citation (Fulton et al. in Publications 3(1):7-26, 2015. 10.3390/publications3010017). The current study covers 148 direct citations from 2006 through 2019 and their 2542 second-generation citations and assesses retraction status visibility of the case study paper and its retraction notice on 12 digital platforms as of 2020. The retraction is not mentioned in 96% (107/112) of direct post-retraction citations for which we were able to conduct citation context analysis. Over 41% (44/107) of direct post-retraction citations that do not mention the retraction describe the case study paper in detail, giving a risk of diffusing misinformation from the case paper. We analyze 152 second-generation citations to the most recent 35 direct citations (2010-2019) that do not mention the retraction but do mention methods or results of the case paper, finding 23 possible diffusions of misinformation from these non-direct citations to the case paper. Link resolving errors from databases show a significant challenge in a reader reaching the retraction notice via a database search. Only 1/8 databases (and 1/9 database records) consistently resolved the retraction notice to its full-text correctly in our tests. Although limited to evaluation of a single case (N = 1), this work demonstrates how retracted research can continue to spread and how the current information environment contributes to this problem.","[Schneider, Jodi] Univ Illinois, Sch Informat Sci, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Ye, Di] Columbia Univ, Data Sci Inst, New York, NY USA; [Ye, Di] Univ Illinois, Dept Stat, Champaign, IL USA; [Hill, Alison M.] Univ South Australia, UniSA Clin & Hlth Sci, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Whitehorn, Ashley S.] Univ South Australia, UniSA Allied Hlth & Human Performance, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia; [Whitehorn, Ashley S.] Univ Adelaide, Joanna Briggs Inst, Sch Populat Hlth, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia","Schneider, J (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Informat Sci, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",jodi@illinois.edu,"Hill, Alison/E-9571-2013","Hill, Alison/0000-0002-6732-4224; Schneider, Jodi/0000-0002-5098-5667",Alfred P.

There has been a corresponding increase in research aimed at understanding opinions and beliefs that are expressed online. However, the generalizability of findings from social media research is a subject of ongoing debate. Social media platforms are conduits of both information and misinformation about vaccines and vaccine hesitancy. Our research objective was to examine whether we can draw similar conclusions from Twitter and national survey data about the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and a broader set of beliefs. In 2018 we conducted a nationally representative survey of parents in the United States informed by a literature review to ask their views on a range of topics, including vaccine side effects, conspiracy theories, and understanding of science. We developed a set of keyword-based queries corresponding to each of the belief items from the survey and pulled matching tweets from 2017. We performed the data pull of the most recent full year of data in 2018. Our primary measures of belief covariation were the loadings and scores of the first principal components obtained using principal component analysis (PCA) from the two sources. We found that, after using manually coded weblinks in tweets to infer stance, there was good qualitative agreement between the first principal component loadings and scores using survey and Twitter data. This held true after we took the additional processing step of resampling the Twitter data based on the number of topics that an individual tweeted about, as a means of correcting for differential representation for elicited (survey) vs. volunteered (Twitter) beliefs. Overall, the results show that analyses using Twitter data may be generalizable in certain contexts, such as assessing belief covariation.","[Nowak, Sarah A.] Univ Vermont, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Nowak, Sarah A.; Gidengil, Courtney A.; Matthews, Luke J.] RAND Corp, Boston, MA 02116 USA; [Chen, Christine] Pardee RAND Grad Sch, Santa Monica, CA USA; [Parker, Andrew M.] RAND Corp, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Gidengil, Courtney A.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Boston, MA USA","Nowak, SA (corresponding author), Univ Vermont, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Larner Coll Med, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.; Nowak, SA (corresponding author), RAND Corp, Boston, MA 02116 USA.",Sarah.Nowak@med.uvm.edu,,"Parker, Andrew/0000-0001-7511-0894",Eunice Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in the National Institutes of Health [R21HD087749],This work was supported by the Eunice Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in the National Institutes of Health (R21HD087749).

It consists of three current transformers (CTs) and three potential transformers (PTs). Cost of IEMS increases with improvement in its accuracy class. The contribution of this article is that, it adduces design and development of high accuracy class and cost-effective IEMS. To accomplish this, a novel Industrial Energy Measurement-Error Compensation Unit (IEM-ECU) is proposed. To realize this, first, the three different accuracy classes,viz.0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 IEMS are fabricated in the laboratory. Characteristics of every CT and PT are determined. Second, the proposed error correction algorithm is implemented in real time to improve errors of IEMS. Finally, the experimental results are depicted in LabVIEW for mixed class of CTs and PTs. Various experimental tests have been performed and results are validated by comparing the results obtained from digital storage oscilloscope. These results clearly illustrate that the proposed IEM-ECU not only convert lower accuracy class IEMS to higher accuracy class but it also gives flexibility to use available class of CTs and/or PTs, if required under contingency. Thereby, considerable cost savings can be achieved as the performance of lower accuracy class matches with the higher accuracy class.","[Ballal, Makarand Sudhakar; Suryawanshi, Hiralal Murlidhar] Visvesvaraya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India; [Wath, Manish Ganesh] Maharashtra State Elect Distribut Co Ltd, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India","Ballal, MS (corresponding author), Visvesvaraya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.",msb_ngp@rediffmail.com,,,,,,28,0,0,3,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1532-5008,1532-5016,,ELECTR POW COMPO SYS,Electr.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of information available on YouTube about restless leg syndrome (RLS). Methods: A YouTube search was carried out on https://www.youtube.com for videos pertaining to restless leg syndrome by using the keyword restless Leg syndrome. The first 100 relevant videos were included in the study. The videos were accepted as useful if they provided scientifically correct information about any aspect of RLS. The videos containing scientifically unproven information are defined as misleading. The overall quality of all videos was subjectively graded using the global qualityscale (GOS), a 5-point Li kert scale. Results:The median video length for the included videos was 3.39 (0.11-85) minutes, and the median views were 6,055 (32-2351490). The median GQS of useful videos was 3 (1-5). The median number of likes and the median number of comments of personal experience videos were significantly higher than that of the useful and misleading videos.

The evergrowing rise in the popularity of OSNs can be attributed to the rapid growth of Internet technology. OSN becomes the easiest way to broadcast media (news/content) over the Internet. In the wake of emerging technologies, there is dire need to develop methodologies, which can minimize the spread of fake messages or rumors that can harm society in any manner. In this article, a model is proposed to investigate the propagation of such messages currently coined as fake news. The proposed model describes how misinformation gets disseminated among groups with the influence of different misinformation refuting measures. With the onset of the novel coronavirus-19 pandemic, dubbed COVID-19, the propagation of fake news related to the pandemic is higher than ever. In this article, we aim to develop a model that will be able to detect and eliminate fake news from OSNs and help ease some OSN users stress regarding the pandemic. A system of differential equations is used to formulate the model. Its stability and equilibrium are also thoroughly analyzed. The basic reproduction number (R-0) is obtained which is a significant parameter for the analysis of message spreading in the OSNs. If the value of R-0 is less than one (R-0 < 1), then fake message spreading in the online network will not be prominent, otherwise if R-0 > 1 the rumor will persist in the OSN. Realworld trends of misinformation spreading in OSNs are discussed. In addition, the model discusses the controlling mechanism for untrusted message propagation. The proposed model has also been validated through extensive simulation and experimentation.","[Shrivastava, Gulshan; Kumar, Prabhat] Natl Inst Technol Patna, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Patna 800005, Bihar, India; [Ojha, Rudra Pratap] Galgotias Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Greater Noida 203201, India; [Srivastava, Pramod Kumar] Rajkiya Engn Coll Azamgarh, Dept Appl Sci, Azamgarh 276201, India; [Mohan, Senthilkumar] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Informat Technol & Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India; [Srivastava, Gautam] Brandon Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Brandon, MB R7A 6A9, Canada; [Srivastava, Gautam] China Med Univ, Res Ctr Interneural Comp, Taichung 40402, Taiwan","Shrivastava, G (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Patna, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Patna 800005, Bihar, India.",gulshanstv@gmail.com,"m, Dr.senthilkumar/L-5551-2015","m, Dr.senthilkumar/0000-0002-8114-3147; Srivastava, Gautam/0000-0001-9851-4103",,,,60,1,1,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-924X,,,IEEE TRANS COMPUT SO,IEEE Trans.

Monitoring social media data has been identified as the best method for tracking rumors in real time and as a possible way to dispel misinformation and reduce stigma. However, the detection, assessment, and response to rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories in real time are a challenge. Therefore, we followed and examined COVID-19-related rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories circulating on online platforms, including fact-checking agency websites, Facebook, Twitter, and online newspapers, and their impacts on public health. Information was extracted between December 31, 2019 and April 5, 2020, and descriptively analyzed. We performed a content analysis of the news articles to compare and contrast data collected from other sources. We identified 2,311 reports of rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories in 25 languages from 87 countries. Claims were related to illness, transmission and mortality (24%), control measures (21%), treatment and cure (19%), cause of disease including the origin (15%), violence (1%), and miscellaneous (20%). Of the 2,276 reports for which text ratings were available, 1,856 claims were false (82%). Misinformation fueled by rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories can have potentially serious implications on the individual and community if prioritized over evidence-based guidelines. Health agenciesmust track misinformation associated with the COVID-19 in real time, and engage local communities and government stakeholders to debunk misinformation.","[Islam, Md Saiful; Sarkar, Tonmoy; Khan, Sazzad Hossain; Yeasmin, Dalia; Islam, Mohammad Ariful; Chowdhury, Kamal Ibne Amin] Icddr B, Infect Dis Div, Program Emerging Infect, 68 Shaheed Tajuddin Ahmed Sarani, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Islam, Md Saiful; Kabir, Alamgir; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Seale, Holly] Univ New South Wales, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Kamal, Abu-Hena Mostofa] Khulna Univ Engn & Technol, Khulna, Bangladesh; [Hasan, S.

To report on vaccine opposition and misinformation promoted on Twitter, highlighting Twitter accounts that drive conversation. Methods. We used supervised machine learning to code all Twitter posts. We first identified codes and themes manually by using a grounded theoretical approach and then applied them to the full data set algorithmically. We identified the top 50 authors month-over-month to determine influential sources of information related to vaccine opposition. Results. The data collection period was June 1 to December 1, 2019, resulting in 356 594 mentions of vaccine opposition. A total of 129 Twitter authors met the qualification of a top author in at least 1 month. Top authors were responsible for 59.5% of vaccine-opposition messages. We identified 10 conversation themes. Themes were similarly distributed across top authors and all other authors mentioning vaccine opposition. Top authors appeared to be highly coordinated in their promotion of misinformation within themes. Conclusions. Public health has struggled to respond to vaccine misinformation. Results indicate that sources of vaccine misinformation are not as heterogeneous or distributed as it may first appear given the volume of messages. There are identifiable upstream sources of misinformation, which may aid in countermessaging and public health surveillance.","[Bonnevie, Erika; Goldbarg, Jaclyn; Gallegos-Jeffrey, Allison K.; Rosenberg, Sarah D.; Smyser, Joe] Publ Good Projects, 2308 Mt Vernon Ave,Suite 758, Alexandria, VA 22301 USA; [Wartella, Ellen] Northwestern Sch Commun, Evanston, IL USA","Bonnevie, E (corresponding author), Publ Good Projects, 2308 Mt Vernon Ave,Suite 758, Alexandria, VA 22301 USA.",erika.borutevie@publicgoodprojects.org,,,New York State Health Foundation,This work was supported by The New York State Health Foundation.,,33,0,0,3,3,AMER PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOC INC,WASHINGTON,"800 I STREET, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20001-3710 USA",0090-0036,1541-0048,,AM J PUBLIC HEALTH,Am.

Methods: An intraoral scanner (LAVA TDS) was used to scan a prepared molar abutment as a master model. The STL file obtained from the scanning process was transferred into the FDM 3D printer (Value 3D Magix MF-1000) and then models were fabricated with PVA filament. In order to compare with the conventional method, an impression of the master model was taken using silicone impression material to fabricate the conventional stone cast model (Cony). An indirect resin composite (Gradia) and self-cured acrylic resin (Curergrace) were used to fabricate crowns (n = 20) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Surface accuracy of the Cony and PVA models and internal accuracy of the crowns set on the models were measured using two methods; 3D digital analysis and silicon-fitting evaluation. Statistical analysis of the results was done using t-test and Willcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni correction at 5% significance. Results: Digital analysis showed the Root Mean Square (RMS) value of PVA model surface was higher than that of Cony, while there was no significant difference between the two crown materials. However, the silicon-fitting analysis showed marginal discrepancy of crowns fabricated on PVA model were within 100 mu m. Conclusion: 3D printed PVA model can be used for chairside crown fabrication with an acceptable accuracy. (C) 2019 Japan Prosthodontic Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ROS may trigger DNA damage, cell mutation, inflammation, cell proliferation, and ultimately they may induce carcinogenesis. This study aims to design, fabricate, and develop a novel on-chip ROS detection based on mounted in-house built fluorescence microscope in microfluidics, which has not been reported previously. An inhouse 3D printed built digital portable fluorescence type microscope for on-chip ROS detection has been developed. The combined use of the fluorescence microscope and a glass-based microfluidic chip both enabled to provide high-quality images of the living cells with ease of controlling and handling of the biological sample. As an evidence of the fluorescence microscope, breast cancer cells were loaded with 2 ',7 '-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA, 50 mu M) for 45 min on-chip which produces green fluorescence upon reaction with intracellular ROS. Fluorescence of the MCF-7 cells has been captured to obtain a profile of ROS generation for 1 day. LabVIEW 2019 was used along with its high-performance image analysis and IMAQ Vision tools. The viability of the cells was performed by LIVE/DEAD assay and Luna cell counter. The developed platform provides real-time monitoring and quantification of ROS. A strong linear correlation between concentrations versus fluorescence has been recorded. This result recommends that the current microfluidic chip provides an in-vitro platform for the assessment of cell cycle progression and evaluation of the variety of drugs.","[Ali, Muhsin; Kim, Young Su; Khalid, Muhammad Asad Ullah; Soomro, Afaque Manzoor; Lee, Jae-Wook; Lim, Jong-Hwan; Choi, Kyung Hyun] Jeju Natl Univ, Dept Mechatron Engn, Jeju, South Korea; [Choi, Kyung Hyun] BioSpero Inc, Jeju Do, South Korea; [Ho, Lee Sang] Off Strateg R&D Planning, Bio PD, 305 Teheran Ro, Seoul, South Korea","Ho, LS (corresponding author), Off Strateg R&D Planning, Bio PD, 305 Teheran Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",amm3713@gmail.com,"Manzoor, Afaque/AAL-3876-2020","Manzoor, Afaque/0000-0002-0352-9319; Khalid, Muhammad Asad Ullah/0000-0001-5926-1764","Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (Ml, Korea) under Industrial Technology Innovation Program [10063277]","This material is based upon work supported by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (Ml, Korea) under Industrial Technology Innovation Program.

Benefit from the effective energy transfer from [BiCl6](3)-octahedron donor to luminescent [MnCl6](4)-acceptor, Cs4MnBi2Cl12 shows a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 25.7% (similar to 610 nm), 51-fold higher than the Bi unalloyed CsMnCl3 center dot 2H(2)O counterpart. Suggested by the theoretical calculations, Bi and Mn exhibit hybridization in conduction and valence band, which further results in a favorable low activation energy for exciton transfer (similar to 23 meV). By virtue of all-inorganic chemical composition, Cs4MnBi2Cl12 exhibits impressive stability toward moisture, light, and heat. Furthermore, Cs4MnBi2Cl12 features strong soft X-ray attenuation and bright radiative luminescence under X-ray excitation, which pave a way for its application in medical flat-panel X-ray digital radiography.

However, the validity of the content on spondyloarthritis (SpA) on YouTube is not known. Objectives To evaluate the content, reliability, and quality of the most viewed English-language YouTube videos on SpA. Methods Keywords spondyloarthritis, spondyloarthropathy, and ankylosing spondylitis were searched on YouTube on October 7, 2019. The top 270 videos were screened. Videos were excluded if they were irrelevant, in non-English language, or if they had no audio. Total number of views, duration on YouTube (days), video length, upload date, and number of likes, dislikes, subscribers, and comments were recorded for videos. A modified 5-point DISCERN tool and the 5-point Global Quality Scale (GQS) score were used to assess the reliability and quality of the videos. Results Two hundred videos were included in the final analysis (62% from healthcare professionals, 37% from patients, and 2% from news channels). Useful information, useful patient opinion, misleading patient opinion, and misleading information comprised o60%, 26%, 11%, and 3% of videos respectively. Majority of misleading videos were uploaded by patients (82%). Misleading videos commonly included wrong clinical features and unproven alternative treatments of SpA. Videos by healthcare professionals had more useful information, higher reliability, and GQS scores. Conclusions Majority of YouTube videos have useful information on SpA and are important educational sources to patients.

In addition to the technological progress of printing systems, the development of functional and low environmental impact printable mixtures is one of the current challenges of digital fabrication in building and architectural fields. This paper proposes a preliminary physical-mechanical analysis on environmentally friendly mortars, compatible with the extrusion-based printing process, made up of recycling rubber aggregates deriving from end-of-life tires. In this study, two groups of rubber particle samples (0-1 mm rubber powder and 2-4 mm rubber granules) were used to partially/totally replace the mineral fraction of the reference printable mixture. Four tire rubber powder-granules proportions were investigated and control mortar (100% sand) was also prepared to compare its properties with those of the rubber-cement samples in terms of printability properties, mechanical strength, ductility, and structural isotropy. Based on the experimental results, the rubber aggregates increase the mixture fluidity, promoting better inter-layer adhesion than the neat mix. This leads to greater mechanical isotropy. As already investigated in other research works on Rubber-Concrete technology, the addition of rubber particles increases the ductility of the material but reduces its mechanical strength. However, by correctly balancing the fine and coarse rubber fraction, promising physical-mechanical performances were demonstrated.","[Sambucci, Matteo; Sibai, Abbas; Valente, Marco] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Sambucci, Matteo; Marini, Danilo; Valente, Marco] Sapienza Univ Rome, INSTM Reference Lab Engn Surface Treatments, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, I-00184 Rome, Italy","Valente, M (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, I-00184 Rome, Italy.; Valente, M (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, INSTM Reference Lab Engn Surface Treatments, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",matteo.sambucci@uniroma1.it; danilo.marini@uniroma1.it; abbas.sibai@uniroma1.it; marco.valente@uniroma1.it,,"Valente, Marco/0000-0002-6298-3693",Sapienza University,"This research was also performed thanks to Sapienza University direct financing, for PhD student Matteo Sambucci, called Avvio alla Ricerca.",,32,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2504-477X,,,J COMPOS SCI,J.

The way they responded to the challenge was different from case to case. Public libraries were the first to realize that they need to find solutions to stay in touch with their users, using the new media technologies, bringing to them credible and upto-date information on topics of interest to each citizen or for each institution. Knowing the aspects of information literacy (especially digital literacy) have proved indispensable to be able to relate in this virtual form. In this paper we want to do a research on the mechanisms identified by each type of library to come in real support of users, given that fake news has invaded social media and it has become increasingly difficult for ordinary people to assess the correctness and the veracity of the information. The analysis was performed on all 41 county libraries plus the Metropolitan Library of Bucharest, National Library of Romania, Library of the Romanian Academy, as well as on a number of university and specialized libraries, the aim being to observe their reaction capacity and adaptability in times of crisis.","[Erich, Agnes Terezia] Valahia Univ Targoviste, Targoviste, Romania","Erich, AT (corresponding author), Valahia Univ Targoviste, Targoviste, Romania.",Agnes_erich@yahoo.com,,,,,,19,0,0,4,4,LUMEN PUBLISHING HOUSE,IASI,"TEPES VODA, NO2, IASI, IASI, 00000, ROMANIA",2068-0236,2069-9387,,POSTMOD OPEN,Postmod.

The situation was made worse by the spread of rumors and false information about what this virus is and ways to prevent it. Objective. - Test how people interact with different information circulating through social media and online platforms. Methods. - The DATA was taken from a survey conducted in 2020 on 1500 quarantined people between the ages 18-60 years old. A questionnaire was created containing most of the rumors and false information circulated, in addition to the correct information with a reliable source. The results were analyzed in the form of tables showing the proportions of supporters and opponents and expressed in numbers and percentages. Results. - A total of 2000 quarantined people participated in the study with the mean age (30.35 +/- 9.9 years). Where the response rate is 100%. The analysis showed a large percentage of support for health protections against the Corona virus, and a large rejection of most of the fake information and rumors circulating across the Internet platforms, in addition to their solidarity within the principles of social responsibility. Conclusion. - The extent of the spread of rumors and false information is decreasing based on the presence of governments and the competent authorities through their official platforms within the mechanism of fighting against the Corona virus, and also taking advantage of the current mistakes to be a shield in the future in dealing with such crises.

These modalities, if applied correctly, could help health systems overcome situations such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the mismanagement of such traditional structures results in fear, stress, anxiety, and risky behavior among society. The current study aimed to assess the penetration of the recommendations and rumors related to PM during the COVID-19 pandemic and the relationships of these recommendations and rumors with related health factors. Methods: In a cross-sectional study performed in March 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) in southern Iran, eligible participants were randomly selected. The participants completed a 29-item online questionnaire assessing different aspects of the rumors and recommendations pertaining to PM linked with the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: In total, 523 participants took part in the survey. The mean fear score was 65.2/100. Approximately 99% of the study population had heard at least one of the rumors/recommendations of PM related to COVID-19. The average scores of disagreement with the rumors and recommendations linked to PM were 16.4/50 and 18.4/35, respectively. The fear score and the level of disagreement with the rumors were significantly related (p = 0.024). Conclusions: The use of PM might be beneficial in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic provided that a revolution occurs in data sharing. Various approaches should be considered in the management of traditional medicine modalities such as PM during disease outbreaks to help overcome the current dilemma.

In the current study, we propose a new approach using a digital workflow and 3-dimensional printing to fabricate clear aligner NAM devices. Methods: A polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) impression of an infant with a unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (UCLP) is acquired and poured, and the stone model is scanned with an intraoral scanner. The stereolithography file is digitized, and the alveolar segments are digitally segmented and moved to the desired final position. The total distance moved is divided into a sequence of 1-1.5 mm increments, creating a series of digital models. The models are 3-dimensionally printed along with button templates to allow free form positioning of the button on each model. A Vacuform machine (Taglus, Mumbai, India) was used to fabricate a 0.040-in aligner for each stage. Results: We present 1 case that was treated successfully with this approach. Appointments for the NAM adjustments were primarily to monitor progress and counseling with less time spent adjusting the appliance. The appointment length was reduced by over 30 minutes. Benefits of the aligner are improved fit, more precise increments of activation, reduced chairside time, and potentially minimized number of visits. Conclusions: NAM custom aligners may provide similar benefits to the traditional approach while reducing the burden of care by reducing the number of visits and appointment duration. Further studies with a sample and longitudinal observations are needed to investigate the benefits of the proposed digital approach.","[Bous, Rany M.; Valiathan, Manish] Case Western Reserve Univ, Craniofacial & Special Care Orthodont, Mt Sinai Dr Edward Reiter Fellowship Program, Dept Orthodont,Sch Dent Med, 9601 Chester Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA; [Kochenour, Nicholas] Akron Childrens Hosp, James A Lehman Jr MD Craniofacial Ctr, Akron, OH 44308 USA","Bous, RM (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Craniofacial & Special Care Orthodont, Mt Sinai Dr Edward Reiter Fellowship Program, Dept Orthodont,Sch Dent Med, 9601 Chester Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",rmb184@case.edu,,"Bous, Rany/0000-0002-6089-4101; Valiathan, Manish/0000-0003-1903-6938",,,,29,0,0,0,0,MOSBY-ELSEVIER,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVENUE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0889-5406,1097-6752,,AM J ORTHOD DENTOFAC,Am.

We sought to understand whether webpages with chemical information are understandable and not misleading to a lay person. Methods Participants were a national probability sample of US adults and adolescents (n=1441, 18% smokers). In an online experiment, we randomly assigned participants to view one of the developed webpages (chemical names only, names with quantity ranges, names with visual risk indicators) or no webpage in phase one (between subjects). Participants completed a survey assessing knowledge, misunderstanding, perceived likelihood, perceived severity of health effects from smoking and quit intentions (smokers only). In phase two (within subjects), participants viewed all three webpage formats and reported webpage perceptions (clarity, usability, usefulness) and perceived impact (affect, elaboration, perceived effectiveness). Results In phase one, viewing any webpage led to more knowledge of chemicals (48%-54% vs 28% no webpage,ps<0.001) and health harms (77% vs 67% no webpage,ps<0.001). When exposed to any webpage, 5%-23% endorsed misunderstandings that some cigarettes are safer than others. Webpage format did not affect knowledge or reduce misunderstandings. Viewing any webpage led to higher perceived likelihood of experiencing health effects from smoking (p<0.001) and, among smokers, greater intentions to quit smoking (p=0.04). In phase two, where participants viewed all formats, a visual risk indicator led to the highest perceived impact. Conclusions Knowledge of chemicals and health effects can increase after viewing a website. Yet, websites may not correct the misunderstanding that some cigarettes are safer.","[Lazard, Allison J.] Univ N Carolina, Sch Media & Journalism, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Lazard, Allison J.; Byron, M.

The highly digital time-based architecture employs a single voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), counter, and digital feedback loop for the readout of an external single-ended highly nonlinear resistive sensor, such as an NTC thermistor. In addition to the inherent first-order noise shaping due to the oscillator, the second loop in SMASH configuration creates second-order noise shaping. Fabricated in 180-nm CMOS, the readout circuit achieves 16.1 bit of resolution for 1-ms conversion time and consumes only 171 mu W, resulting in an excellent 2.4-pJ/c.s. FOMW for a resistive sensor interface while occupying only 0.064 mm(2). The specific closed-loop architecture tackles the VCO nonlinearity, achieving more than 14 bits of linearity. Multiple prototype chip samples have been measured in a temperature-controlled environment from -40 degrees C to 125 degrees C for the readout of commercial external NTC thermistors. A maximum temperature inaccuracy of 0.3 degrees C is achieved with only one-point trimming at room temperature. Since the circuit architecture decouples the sensor excitation from the feedback, high electromagnetic interference (EMI) immunity at the sensor node is demonstrated as well.","[Sacco, Elisa; Gielen, Georges] Katholieke Univ Leuven, MICAS Lab, Dept Elect Engn ESAT, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Vergauwen, Johan] Melexis Technol NV, B-3980 Tessenderlo, Belgium","Sacco, E (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, MICAS Lab, Dept Elect Engn ESAT, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",elisa.sacco@esat.kuleuven.be,,"Sacco, Elisa/0000-0002-0775-5815",Vlaanderen Agentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen (VLAIO); Melexis,This work was supported in part by Vlaanderen Agentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen (VLAIO) and in part by Melexis.,,36,0,0,1,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9200,1558-173X,,IEEE J SOLID-ST CIRC,IEEE J.

The interface utilizes duty-cycling to reduce the static power consumption of resistive bridge sensors, which are commonly used in implantable, wearable, and internet of things (IoT) applications, such as intracranial pressure (ICP) sensing and blood pressure (BP) monitoring. The proposed interface uses a revised version of the pseudo-pseudo differential (PPD) topology with the ping-pong technique to reduce the complexity of traditional fully-differential counterparts. A proof-of-concept prototype has been fabricated in 0.35-mu m CMOS and occupies an active area of 0.48 mm(2). It achieves 9.13 effective number of bits (ENOB) at 3.72 kHz sampling rate and improvement of more than 50 dB in the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) by employing the ping-pong technique. It reduces the power consumption of a 5-k Omega Wheatstone bridge by 99.6% compared to a traditional interface, down to 2.53 mu w at 1.8 V supply.

For instance, the recent outcomes of the US presidential elections and the Brexit vote show that misinformation and otherwise influencing content can affect events of great importance. In this paper, we adopt a simplified version of the recently proposed Network Knowledge Base (NKB) model to tackle the problem of predicting basic actions that a user can take given the content of their social media feeds: either take action (by reusing content seen in their feeds or creating new one), or otherwise take no action. We propose processing raw data obtained from social media based on the framework defined by the NKB model, and then formulate an action/no action prediction task that takes as input five features (including the user's personality type and other social cues), and then go on to show-via an extensive empirical evaluation with real-world Twitter data-that machine learning classification algorithms can be successfully applied in this setting to make predictions about user reactions. The main result obtained is that, out of the features considered, personality type based on the Big-5 (also known as OCEAN) model is the most impactful; furthermore, though the rest of the features taken individually do not have a significant impact, the best results are obtained when they are all taken together. This is a first step in applying the NKB model towards understanding the effect of pathogenic social media phenomena such as fake news, how they spread via cascades, and how to counteract their ill effects.

Countermeasures adopted thus far to curb these informational disorders have had limited success because these did not account for the diversity of informational contexts on social media, focusing instead almost exclusively on curating the factual content of user's posts. However, content-focused measures do not address the primary causes of the infodemic itself, namely the user's need to post content as a way of making sense of the situation and for gathering reactions of consensus from friends. This paper describes three types of informational context-weak epistemic, strong normative and strong emotional-which have not yet been taken into account by current measures to curb down the informational disorders.

However, fake news, like a wide-spreading virus, is infecting the global journalism. Taking China's top fake news from 2001 to 2019 as an example, the study endorses a social pathological approach to address the symptoms, etiology, and developing trend of fake news. Through symptoms diagnosis, the study contributes more categories to the previous typology of fake news: click-bait, alarmist talk, subjective assumption, user-generated content (UGC)-news, hearsay, and incorrect-data news. Etiology analysis shows that Chinese fake news is mainly about social life partially because of no previous tradition of verifying daily statements from politicians. Trend predictions reveal that online media, hearsay, and social life-related news of unverified single sources are the main problems which are different from the West and require special attention in the future. The proposed solution for the Chinese press and media outlets is to cooperate with internet platforms and establish a comprehensive fact-checking mechanism, integrating professional journalism, data and visualization technology, specialized knowledge, and communication efficiency.","[Wang, Min] Wuhan Univ, Ctr Studies Media Dev, Sch Journalism & Commun, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Rao, Mingke] Univ Leeds, Sch Media & Commun, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Sun, Zhipeng] Wuhan Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Wuhan, Peoples R China","Wang, M (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Ctr Studies Media Dev, Sch Journalism & Commun, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",carterwm@qq.com,,,Research Project of Young Scholars in Humanities and Social Sciences of Wuhan University [2020AI007],The research is supported by the Research Project of Young Scholars in Humanities and Social Sciences of Wuhan University (No. 2020AI007).,,89,0,0,9,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

These rates may be influenced by limited diffusion of evidence-based research and guidelines from the scientific community (SC). As recently highlighted by the National Academy of Sciences, there is a need for the SC to diffuse its findings to the public more effectively online, as means to counteract the spread of misinformation. In response to this call, we gathered data from Twitter for one month from major breastfeeding hashtags resulting in an interconnected social network (n= 3,798 users). We then identified 59 influencers who disproportionately influenced information flow using social network analysis. These influencers were from the SC (e.g. academics, researchers, health care practitioners), as well as interested citizens (IC) and companies. We then conducted an ego-network analysis of influencer networks, developed ego maps, and compared diffusion metrics across the SC, IC and company influencers. We also qualitatively analyzed their tweets (n = 711) to understand the type of information being diffused. SC influencers were the least efficient communicators. Although having the highest tweeting activity (80% of tweets), they did not reach more individuals compared to IC and companies (two-step ego size: 220 +/- 99, 188 +/- 124, 169 +/- 97 respectively,P= 0.28). Content analysis of tweets suggest IC are more active than the SC in diffusing evidence-based breastfeeding knowledge, with 35% of their tweets around recent research findings compared to only 12% by the SC. Nonetheless, in terms of outreach to the general public, the two-step networks of SC influences were more heterogenous than ICs (55.7 +/- 5.07, 50.9 +/- 12.0, respectively,P<0.001). Collectively, these findings suggest SC influencers may possess latent potential to diffuse research and evidence- based practices. However, the research suggests specific ways to enhance diffusion.","[Moukarzel, Sara] Univ Calif San Diego, Larsson Rosenquist Fdn Mother Milk Infant Ctr Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Moukarzel, Sara; Daly, Alan J.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Educ Studies, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Rehm, Martin] Univ Educ Weingarten, Inst Educ Consulting, Weingarten, Germany; [del Fresno, Miguel] Natl Distance Educ Univ, Dept Social Work, Madrid, Spain","Moukarzel, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Larsson Rosenquist Fdn Mother Milk Infant Ctr Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.; Moukarzel, S (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Educ Studies, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",smoukarzel@ucsd.edu,"Rehm, Martin/ABG-3180-2020","Rehm, Martin/0000-0002-9553-7008",Family Larsson-Rosenquist Foundation; Larsson Rosequist Foundation,SM is supported by a fellowship from the Larsson Rosequist Foundation.; We gratefully acknowledge the support of the Family Larsson-Rosenquist Foundation.,,36,1,1,1,1,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,AUG 13,2020,15,8,,,,,,,e0237471,10.1371/journal.pone.0237471,,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NE5VG,WOS:000562668300074,32790712,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-18,

It chronicles official statements from various library and information associations as they were released in real-time, thereby providing a contemporary and historical snapshot of the early stages of this global health crisis. The aim is to both historically and thematically contextualize these initial responses to help establish a foundation upon which to anchor, build, extend and analyze approaches to the pandemic as it unfolded (and indeed as it continues to unfold at the time of this writing in June 2020). Design/methodology/approach - Drawing upon a qualitative documentary analysis of statements on COVID-19 released by various international library and information associations, this study provides a thematic analysis of these contemporary policies. Specifically, this thematic analysis was carried out to identify and illuminate major themes appearing within the statements. Further, a comparative thematic analysis was then undertaken to compare the themes across all statements to discover and determine convergences or divergences in content and coverage. Findings - The formal statements released by these organizations feature and share many similar themes in their initial responses to COVID-19, including support for/solidarity with libraries; information provision; maintaining services; digital migration of services; workplace arrangements/concerns; contextual contingencies of libraries (diversity of kinds, circumstances and challenges); health concerns and proper/good hygiene; countering dis/misinformation; external collaborations with public health agencies; and partnerships with industry including publishers. Research limitations/implications - Although this study's purview is admittedly limited in size and scope - involving six, albeit major, library and information associations from mainly English speaking countries - it can be used as a foundation for further studies into how libraries and information centres in other English and non-English speaking countries responded to the coronavirus pandemic. Practical implications - This study can help inform current, alternative, contingency or other future library responses geared towards or tailored for the coronavirus or other health-related crises. It can also be used as a baseline to track the trajectory of library responses and actions as they unfolded throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Social implications - By providing the start of an account and analysis of the international library and information science (LIS) community's initial responses, this study also contributes to the broader (ongoing) conversation about the coronavirus pandemic and intervenes in emerging historical examinations of this crisis. This study could be of interest to LIS scholars and practitioners, in addition to public health researchers, public policymakers, cultural studies academics and historians, interested in how different and intersectional efforts - in this case, the international LIS community - contributed and can contribute to this pandemic and other similar or parallel crises. Originality/value - The international library and information community's initial responses to this global health crisis are contextualized, thereby serving as a foundation upon which to anchor, build and extend other research on responses to the pandemic as it unfolded. Drawing upon a qualitative documentary analysis of these statements, this study presents and discusses the international library community's initial responses to the coronavirus pandemic. It chronicles these statements as they were released in real-time, thereby providing a contemporary and historical snapshot of the early stages of this crisis. The aim is to both historically and thematically contextualize the international library and information community's initial responses to help establish a foundation upon which to anchor, build, extend and update the international library community's responses to the pandemic as it unfolded (and indeed as it continues to unfold at the time of this writing in June 2020). This foundation, it is hoped, will help illuminate their respective positions, circumstances, convergences, divergences and areas of possible (future) cooperation, coordination and collaboration.","[Kosciejew, Marc] Univ Malta, Dept Lib Informat & Arch Sci, Msida, Malta","Kosciejew, M (corresponding author), Univ Malta, Dept Lib Informat & Arch Sci, Msida, Malta.",mkosciej@gmail.com,,,,,,51,0,0,29,29,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2514-9342,2514-9350,,GLOB KNOWL MEM COMMU,Glob.

Methods: YouTube (TM) (www.YouTube.com) was searched using vaccines as a keyword. Videos in French with at least 10,000 views were identified. For each video, specific descriptive information including the opinion on vaccination was identified. To study the anti-vaccine reaction linked to a change in French policy on vaccination, the main arguments used in videos with negative opinions on vaccination uploaded in 2017 and 2018 were also collected. Results: We identified 166 videos: 120 (72.2%) were considered anti-vaccine videos and 46 (27.8%) were pro-vaccine; 92 (55%) were uploaded between 2017 and 2018. The anti-vaccine videos had been viewed 5,129,215 times and the pro-vaccine videos 2,371,048 times. The three most widely used anti-vaccination arguments were in regard to side effects (75.8%), pharmaceutical lobbying (61.3%), and the presence of adjuvants (51.6%). Conclusion: Health professionals should be aware of the widely disseminated vaccination misinformation available on the Internet. Health professionals and health authorities must invest in these platforms, perhaps in collaboration with popular channels, to inform users accurately and to refute arguments put forward by anti-vaccine videos. Increasing and maintaining vaccination use is vital for vaccines to achieve success, particularly in France where vaccine hesitancy is strong. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, however, social media offers a promising avenue to stem the distribution of false claims - as evidenced by real-time corrections, crowdsourced fact-checking, and algorithmic tagging. Despite the growing attempts to correct misinformation on social media, there is still considerable ambiguity regarding the ability to effectively ameliorate the negative impact of false messages. To address this gap, the current study uses a meta-analysis to evaluate the relative impact of social media interventions designed to correct health-related misinformation (k= 24;N= 6,086). Additionally, the meta-analysis introduces theory-driven moderators that help delineate the effectiveness of social media interventions. The mean effect size of attempts to correct misinformation on social media was positive and significant (d= 0.40, 95% CI [0.25, 0.55],p=.0005) and a publication bias could not be excluded. Interventions were more effective in cases where participants were involved with the health topic, as well as when misinformation was distributed by news organizations (vs. peers) and debunked by experts (vs. non-experts). The findings of this meta-analysis can be used not only to depict the current state of the literature but also to prescribe specific recommendations to better address the proliferation of health misinformation on social media.","[Walter, Nathan; Brooks, John J.; Saucier, Camille J.; Suresh, Sapna] Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA","Walter, N (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",nathan.walter@northwestern.edu,,,,,,52,2,2,8,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1041-0236,1532-7027,,HEALTH COMMUN,Health Commun.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/10410236.2020.1794553,,AUG 2020,9,Communication; Health Policy & Services,Communication; Health Care Sciences & Services,MV7EG,WOS:000556515700001,32762260,Bronze,,,2020-12-18,

Pakistan is quite vulnerable to such conspiracy narratives and has experienced failures of polio vaccination programs because of such claims. Recently, two well-known political figures raised conspiracy theories against COVID-19 vaccines in Pakistan, stating that COVID-19 is a grand illusion and a conspiracy against Muslim countries. This theory is much discussed in the local community, supporting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We urge healthcare authorities in Pakistan to take necessary measures against such claims before they penetrate to the general community. Anti-vaccine movements could undermine efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that ethical and responsible behavior of mass media, a careful advisory from the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, stern measures from healthcare authorities, effective maneuvers to increase public awareness on COVID-19, vigorous analysis of information by data or communications scientists, and publication of counter opinions from health professionals against such theories will go a long way in neutralizing such misleading claims.

The paper focuses on the number of news features by period and by disaster and analyzes related words based on big data. The results of the analysis are as follows. First, in the initial response phase, keywords to identify accurate sources of actual broadcast contents, fake news, social networking service (SNS), etc. were also ranked in the top 20. Second, in the active response phase, when the number of confirmed persons and the government's countermeasures were announced, more than 100 COVID-19-related articles were issued, and the related words increased rapidly from the initial response stage. Therefore, the fact that COVID-19 has been expressed as a keyword indicates that our society is watching with great interest in the government's response to the disease.","[Jung, Ji-Hee] Univ Ulsan, Dept Business Adm, 93 Daehak Ro, Ulsan 44610, South Korea; [Shin, Jae-Ik] Gyeongnam Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Distribut, 33 Dongjin Ro, Jinju 52725, Gyeongnam, South Korea","Shin, JI (corresponding author), Gyeongnam Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Distribut, 33 Dongjin Ro, Jinju 52725, Gyeongnam, South Korea.",aboutjee@ulsan.ac.kr; sji@gntech.ac.kr,,,,,,25,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Findings from a survey of 511 Chinese respondents suggest that, overall, individuals would perceive themselves to be less vulnerable than close others and distant others to the impact of COVID-19 digital disinformation. The highest self-other perceptual discrepancy is found when individuals receive disinformation on mobile social networking apps. Also, individuals who practice more active fact-checking perceive themselves to be less susceptible. The perception of disinformation effects on self as well as the self-other perceptual discrepancy is both positively related to emotional responses (anxiety, fear, and worry) to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study contributes to existing research by linking exposure to disinformation in different digital channels, the TPEs, and emotional outcomes in the context of a public health crisis. It also highlights the importance of educating and enabling fact-checking behaviors on digital media, which could help to reduce negative emotional impact of the disinformation.","[Liu, Piper Liping] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Blk AS6,03-34,11 Comp Dr, Singapore 117416, Singapore; [Huang, Lei Vincent] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Liu, PL (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Blk AS6,03-34,11 Comp Dr, Singapore 117416, Singapore.",llpsxx@hotmail.com,,,,,,30,1,1,18,18,"MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC",NEW ROCHELLE,"140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA",2152-2715,2152-2723,,CYBERPSYCH BEH SOC N,Cyberpsychology Behav.

However, misinformation is easily generated and amplified when a rapidly evolving epidemiological situation is coupled with gaps in scientific knowledge about a novel pathogen. Groups involved in health policy research, advocacy, implementation, and enforcement must be aware of three key challenges as they develop and apply communication strategies during emergencies: (i) information overload, (ii) information uncertainty, and (iii) misinformation. These challenges can be countered by accurately communicating core messages to specific audiences, being transparent about the evidence base for recommendations and open about the likelihood that guidelines may change as scientific discoveries are made, and identifying which myths and conspiracy theories circulating on social media are so harmful that they must be directly countered.

Networked civic monitoring of populist radical right online action in Finland",INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social media; activism; anti-racism; populism; radical right; surveillance,SOCIAL MEDIA; HATE SPEECH; INTERNET; PARTIES,"This article analyses civic monitoring that targets online radical right populist anti-immigration activism in Finland to discuss whether outsourcing monitoring to platform users is a feasible means to respond to exclusionary-populist online communication. For several reasons, the widely discussed - and potentially harmful - phenomena related to the emancipation of radical right populist online counterpublics have proved difficult to control. First of all, using exclusionary and antagonistic rhetoric or spreading disinformation is not illegal, which makes policing it ineffective. Second, journalistic scrutiny tends to increase the salience of radical right agendas without significantly curbing their appeal. Third, social media companies have passed down responsibility for monitoring extremism on their platforms to users. As an option, it has been suggested that users could organize to push potentially harmful content to the margins of online publics. The study reveals that the materiality of online anti-immigration action allows it to be monitored by anti-racist activists to a certain extent, and that online action aimed at resisting online radical right activism ranges from civil counter-arguing and pursuing of deliberation to anti-racist hate speech and naming-and-shaming campaigns. There are notable caveats that undermine the efficacy and viability of civic monitoring as a means of watching over radical right populist online action. The main problems are related to the connective and potentially anti-populist nature of the civic monitoring - allowing it to be counter-surveilled and used as fuel for populist online communication - and potential danger and harm to the activists involved.","[Hatakka, Niko] Univ Turku, Ctr Parliamentary Studies, Dept Philosophy Polit Sci & Contemporary Hist, Turku 20014, Finland","Hatakka, N (corresponding author), Univ Turku, Ctr Parliamentary Studies, Dept Philosophy Polit Sci & Contemporary Hist, Turku 20014, Finland.",nthata@utu.fi,,,,,,67,3,3,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the psychobehavioral responses to the COVID-19 outbreak and examine their associations with mass and social media exposure. Methods: A cross-sectional study among medical and health sciences students from the Fujian Medical University in Fuzhou, China, was conducted between April 6-22, 2020. Results: A total of 2086 completed responses were received. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that four constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM)-higher perception of susceptibility (odds ratio [OR] 1.44; 95% CI 1.07-1.94), severity (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.10-1.59), self-efficacy (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.21-2.15), and perceived control or intention to carry out prevention measures (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.09-1.59)-were significantly associated with a higher mass media exposure score, whereas only three constructs-higher perception of severity (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.19-1.72), self-efficacy (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.38-2.48), and perceived control or intention to carry out prevention measures (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.08-1.58)-were significantly associated with a higher social media exposure score. Lower emotional consequences and barriers to carry out prevention measures were also significantly associated with greater mass and social media exposure. Our findings on anxiety levels revealed that 38.1% (n=795; 95% CI 36.0-40.2) of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. A lower anxiety level was significantly associated with higher mass and social media exposure in the univariable analyses; however, the associations were not significant in the multivariable analyses. Conclusions: In essence, both mass and social media are useful means of disseminating health messages and contribute to the betterment of psychobehavioral responses to COVID-19. Our findings stress the importance of the credibility of information shared through mass and social media outlets and viable strategies to counter misinformation during a pandemic.","[Lin, Yulan; Hu, Zhijian; Wong, Li Ping] Fujian Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Hlth Stat, Fujian Prov Key Lab Environm Factors & Canc, 1 Xue Yuan Rd, Fuzhou 350122, Peoples R China; [Alias, Haridah; Wong, Li Ping] Univ Malaya, Fac Med, Ctr Epidemiol & Evidence Based Practice, Dept Social & Prevent Med, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Hu, ZJ (corresponding author), Fujian Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Hlth Stat, Fujian Prov Key Lab Environm Factors & Canc, 1 Xue Yuan Rd, Fuzhou 350122, Peoples R China.",huzhijian@fjmu.edu.cn,"Wong, Li Ping/C-1049-2010","Wong, Li Ping/0000-0002-0107-0532",Pilot Project of Fujian Provincial Department of Science Technology [2020Y0005]; Fujian Medical University's Rapid Response Funding Call for COVID-19 Related Research [2020YJ003],"This study was supported by The Pilot Project of Fujian Provincial Department of Science & Technology (No. 2020Y0005), and Fujian Medical University's Rapid Response Funding Call for COVID-19 Related Research (No. 2020YJ003).",,31,3,3,12,12,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

We randomly assigned participants to one of two experimental conditions: humor correction versus non-humor correction. Our analyses revealed that the humor correction increased attention to the image portion of the correction tweet, and this attention indirectly lowered HPV misperceptions by reducing the credibility of the misinformation tweet. The study also found that the non-humor correction outperformed the humor correction in reducing misperceptions via its higher credibility ratings.

Thus, automatic debunking of rumors is of great importance to keep social media a healthy environment. While facing a dubious claim, people often dispute its truthfulness sporadically in their posts containing various cues, which can form useful evidence with long-distance dependencies. In this work, we propose to learn discriminative features from microblog posts by following their non-sequential propagation structure and generate more powerful representations for identifying rumors. For modeling non-sequential structure, we first represent the diffusion of microblog posts with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how a claim in the original post is transmitted and developed over time. We then present a bottom-up and a top-down tree-structured models based on Recursive Neural Networks (RvNN) for rumor representation learning and classification, which naturally conform to the message propagation process in microblogs. To enhance the rumor representation learning, we reveal that effective rumor detection is highly related to finding evidential posts, e.g., the posts expressing specific attitude towards the veracity of a claim, as an extension of the previous RvNN-based detection models that treat every post equally. For this reason, we design discriminative attention mechanisms for the RvNN-based models to selectively attend on the subset of evidential posts during the bottom-up/top-down recursive composition. Experimental results on four datasets collected from real-world microblog platforms confirm that (1) our RvNN-based models achieve much better rumor detection and classification performance than state-of-the-art approaches; (2) the attention mechanisms for focusing on evidential posts can further improve the performance of our RvNN-based method; and (3) our approach possesses superior capacity on detecting rumors at a very early stage.","[Ma, Jing] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Kowloon Tong, 6F,David C Lam Bldg,55 Renfrew Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Gao, Wei] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, 80 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178902, Singapore; [Joty, Shafiq] Nanyang Technol Univ, Block N4,02c-79,Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Joty, Shafiq] Salesforce Res, Singapore, Singapore; [Wong, Kam-Fai] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept SEEM, CUHK, Shatin, Room 601,Ho Sin Hang Engn Bldg, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wong, Kam-Fai] MoE Key Lab High Confidence Software Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Ma, J (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Kowloon Tong, 6F,David C Lam Bldg,55 Renfrew Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",mmjjblue@gmail.com; weigao@smu.edu.sg; srjoty@ntu.edu.sg; kfwong@se.cuhk.edu.hk,,,"Hong Kong RGC GRFHong Kong Research Grants Council [14204118, 14209416]; ITF [ITS/335/18]","This work is partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF (14204118, 14209416) and ITF (ITS/335/18).",,59,2,2,2,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA",2157-6904,2157-6912,,ACM T INTEL SYST TEC,ACM Trans.

Accompanying this pandemic is a parallel infodemic, including the online marketing and sale of unapproved, illegal, and counterfeit COVID-19 health products including testing kits, treatments, and other questionable cures. Enabling the proliferation of this content is the growing ubiquity of internet-based technologies, including popular social media platforms that now have billions of global users. Objective: This study aims to collect, analyze, identify, and enable reporting of suspected fake, counterfeit, and unapproved COVID-19-related health care products from Twitter and Instagram. Methods: This study is conducted in two phases beginning with the collection of COVID-19-related Twitter and Instagram posts using a combination of web scraping on Instagram and filtering the public streaming Twitter application programming interface for keywords associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 products. The second phase involved data analysis using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to identify potential sellers that were then manually annotated for characteristics of interest. We also visualized illegal selling posts on a customized data dashboard to enable public health intelligence. Results: We collected a total of 6,029,323 tweets and 204,597 Instagram posts filtered for terms associated with suspect marketing and sale of COVID-19 health products from March to April for Twitter and February to May for Instagram. After applying our NLP and deep learning approaches, we identified 1271 tweets and 596 Instagram posts associated with questionable sales of COVID-19-related products. Generally, product introduction came in two waves, with the first consisting of questionable immunity-boosting treatments and a second involving suspect testing kits. We also detected a low volume of pharmaceuticals that have not been approved for COVID-19 treatment. Other major themes detected included products offered in different languages, various claims of product credibility, completely unsubstantiated products, unapproved testing modalities, and different payment and seller contact methods. Conclusions: Results from this study provide initial insight into one front of the infodemic fight against COVID-19 by characterizing what types of health products, selling claims, and types of sellers were active on two popular social media platforms at earlier stages of the pandemic. This cybercrime challenge is likely to continue as the pandemic progresses and more people seek access to COVID-19 testing and treatment. This data intelligence can help public health agencies, regulatory authorities, legitimate manufacturers, and technology platforms better remove and prevent this content from harming the public.","[Mackey, Tim Ken; Nali, Matthew] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, 8950 Villa La Jolla Dr,A124, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Mackey, Tim Ken; Nali, Matthew] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis & Global Publ Hlth, 8950 Villa La Jolla Dr,A124, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Mackey, Tim Ken; Li, Jiawei; Shah, Neal] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Healthcare Res & Policy, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Mackey, Tim Ken; Li, Jiawei; Purushothaman, Vidya; Nali, Matthew; Shah, Neal; Cai, Mingxiang; Liang, Bryan] Global Hlth Policy & Data Inst, San Diego, CA USA; [Mackey, Tim Ken; Li, Jiawei; Nali, Matthew; Cai, Mingxiang] S3 Res LLC, San Diego, CA USA; [Purushothaman, Vidya] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Family Med & Publ Hlth, Masters Publ Hlth Program, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bardier, Cortni] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Anthropol, Masters Program Global Hlth, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA","Mackey, TK (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, 8950 Villa La Jolla Dr,A124, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.; Mackey, TK (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Med, Div Infect Dis & Global Publ Hlth, 8950 Villa La Jolla Dr,A124, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",tmackey@ucsd.edu,"Mackey, Tim/H-9156-2013","Mackey, Tim/0000-0002-2191-7833; Liang, Bryan/0000-0001-7801-5673; Shah, Neal/0000-0001-8670-6124",,,,51,0,0,4,4,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",2369-2960,,,JMIR PUBLIC HLTH SUR,JMIR Public Health Surveill.,JUL-SEP,2020,6,3,,,,,360,376,e20794,10.2196/20794,,,17,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",OC1UL,WOS:000578947300035,32750006,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-18,

To answer these questions, we conducted twelve interviews with some of the individuals behind the accounts and descriptively analyzed 43,569 tweets generated by these 102 accounts during the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. We discovered that not all accounts were not actually being run by agency employees, and that the account administrators had goals of creating a network of resistance by sharing scientific information, correcting misinformation, and contributing to the news cycle. They relied on the referentiality that Twitter affords through its features to expand beyond 140 characters to do this.","[Oltmann, Shannon M.; Cooper, Troy B.; Proferes, Nicholas] Univ Kentucky, 320 Lucille Little Lib, Lexington, KY 40506 USA","Oltmann, SM (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, 320 Lucille Little Lib, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",Shannon.oltmann@uky.edu; tony.cooper@uky.edu; nproferes@uky.edu,,"Proferes, Nicholas/0000-0002-0295-9616",,,,48,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER INC,SAN DIEGO,"525 B STREET, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0740-624X,1872-9517,,GOV INFORM Q,Gov.

For COVID-19, in many parts of the world, such misinformation is circulating through globally popular mobile instant messaging services (MIMS) like WhatsApp and Telegram. Compared to more public social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, these services offer private, intimate, and often encrypted spaces for users to chat with family members and friends, making it difficult for the platform to moderate misinformation on them. Thus, there is an enhanced onus on users of MIMS to curb misinformation by correcting their family and friends within these spaces. Research on understanding how such relational correction occurs in different parts of the globe will need to attend to how the nature of these interpersonal relationships and the cultural dynamics that influence them shape the correction process. Thus, as people increasingly use MIMS to connect with close relations to make sense of this global crisis, studying the issue of misinformation on these services requires us to adopt a relationship-centered and culturally informed approach.","[Malhotra, Pranav] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Malhotra, P (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Commun, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",pranav23@uw.edu,,"Malhotra, Pranav/0000-0002-2144-8133",,,,22,0,0,5,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

A digital outbreak of disinformation has spread around the COVID-19 pandemic, often referred to as an infodemic. Since January 2020, digital media have been both the culprits of and antidotes to misinformation. The first months of the pandemic have shown that countering disinformation online has become as important as ensuring much needed medical equipment and supplies for health workers. For many governments around the world, priority COVID-19 actions included measures such as (a) providing guidance to social media companies on taking down contentious pandemic content (e.g., India); (b) establishing special units to combat disinformation (e.g., EU, UK); and (c) criminalizing malicious coronavirus falsehood, including in relation to public health measures. This article explores the short and potential long-term effects of newly passed legislation in various countries directly targeting COVID-19 disinformation on the media, whether traditional or digital. The early actions enacted under the state-of-emergency carve new directions in negotiating the delicate balance between freedom of expression and online censorship, in particular by imposing limitations on access to information and inducing self-restraint in reporting. Based on comparative legal analysis, this article provides a timely discussion of intended and unintended consequences of such legal responses to the infodemic, reflecting on a basic set of safeguards needed to preserve trust in online information.","[Radu, Roxana] Univ Oxford, Ctr Sociolegal Studies, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Radu, Roxana] Univ Geneva, Geneva Transformat Governance Lab, Geneva, Switzerland","Radu, R (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Ctr Sociolegal Studies, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",roxana.radu@csls.ox.ac.uk,,,Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [P2GEP1_178007],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation under Grant P2GEP1_178007.",,13,0,0,4,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

The hashtag encouraged people to visit local hospitals to take pictures and videos of empty hospitals to help prove that the COVID-19 pandemic is an elaborate hoax. Using techniques from Social Network Analysis, this case study examines how this conspiracy theory propagated on Twitter and whether the hashtag virality was aided by the use of automation or coordination among Twitter users. We found that while much of the content came from users with limited reach, the oxygen that fueled this conspiracy in its early days came from a handful of prominent conservative politicians and far right political activists on Twitter. These power users used this hashtag to build awareness about the campaign and to encourage their followers to break quarantine and film what is happening at their local hospitals. After the initial boost by a few prominent accounts, the campaign was mostly sustained by pro-Trump accounts, followed by a secondary wave of propagation outside the U.S. The rise of the #FilmYourHospital conspiracy from a single tweet demonstrates the ongoing challenge of addressing false, viral information during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the spread of misinformation can be potentially mitigated by fact-checking and directing people to credible sources of information from public health agencies, false and misleading claims that are driven by politics and supported by strong convictions and not science are much harder to root out.","[Gruzd, Anatoliy; Mai, Philip] Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Social Media Lab, Toronto, ON, Canada","Gruzd, A (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Ted Rogers Sch Management, Social Media Lab, Toronto, ON, Canada.",gruzd@ryerson.ca,,"Gruzd, Anatoliy/0000-0003-2366-5163; Mai, Philip/0000-0002-6950-1220",Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Canada Research Chairs programCanada Research Chairs; Compute Canada,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (PIs: Veletsianos, Hodson, Gruzd), and is also supported by the Canada Research Chairs program (PI: Gruzd) and a Compute Canada computing grant (PI: Gruzd).",,33,3,3,39,39,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-9517,,,BIG DATA SOC,Big Data Soc.,JUL,2020,7,2,,,,,,,2.05395E+15,10.1177/2053951720938405,,,9,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Sciences - Other Topics,MT4ET,WOS:000554923700001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020-12-18,

Women, in particular, are becoming victims of hostilities on the digital scenario. This problem is currently known as digital sexism and gender disinformation. In this context, verification journalism, a trendy format, aims to reduce the effects of hoaxes introducing the fact-checking process in its professional routines. However, this is still a minority task. In order to contribute to the study of the disinformation phenomenon in relation to online messages about women, this research has developed a systematic tool to classify hoaxes that have been refuted by the platform Maldita.es, specifically, on its sections Maldito Feminismo (N=71). This tool, inspired by the taxonomies created by Derakhshan & Wardle (2017), Tandoc, Lim & Ling (2018) and Molina, Sundar, Le & Lee (2019), allows you to categorize fake news according to the type of information disorder, the agent, the message and the interpreter. The results of this study (internal validity) show that hoaxes detected by Maldito Feminismo are misleading content that expect to damage feminism (this is the main topic of fake news) and have a political purpose. These information disorders are displayed in text format and are mainly created and distributed on social networks. Moreover, although users collaborate and participate detecting and reporting hoaxes, the platform Maldito Feminismo identifies, locates and denounces most of the fake news.","[Herrero-Diz, Paula; Perez-Escolar, Marta; Plaza Sanchez, Juan F.] Loyola Andalucia Univ, Dept Commun & Educ, Seville, Spain","Herrero-Diz, P (corresponding author), Loyola Andalucia Univ, Dept Commun & Educ, Seville, Spain.",,,,European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [2019-1-ES01-KA201-064365],This project is supported by the European Union / Eramus+ KA201: Asociaciones estrategicas para la Educacion Escolar.

Despite its great benefits, there has been a growing sense of distrust in the safety of vaccines and vaccination programs, leading to unwillingness to vaccinate or even refusal of vaccines altogether. The aim of this study was to determine parental attitudes toward vaccination and to derive information that would help develop appropriate strategies to tackle vaccine hesitancy and refusal (V-HR). Methods A 15-item questionnaire was administered during a face-to-face interview with 1,440 parents (88.1% women, median age: 32 years) whose children were followed up and treated in pediatric outpatient and/or inpatient clinics between July and September 2019. The influential factors on parental V-HR were statistically analyzed. Results The majority of the parents were in favor of vaccination without doubt (n = 1,184, 82.2%). The overall V-HR rate was 17.8%, with 16% of the parents (n = 230) expressing hesitancy and 1.8% (n = 26) completely refusing vaccination. Educational status significantly affected V-HR (p = 0.001), with a higher proportion of V-HR parents having a higher educational level (high school-university) than those having a lower educational status. The prevalence of V-HR was significantly higher among parents who drew vaccination-related information from written, visual, and social media (p < 0.001). Among the 256 parents, parental V-HR most commonly arose from perceived risk and safety concerns, with the feeling that vaccines might lead to another disease such as autism (57%), and the fear that vaccines might cause side effects (33%). Conclusion Parental V-HR has transformed into an alarming global health problem. Of particular importance is monitoring and assessing parental V-HR in every aspect, particularly the media sources that continuously disseminate misinformation about vaccination. Besides nationwide projects to encourage vaccination, appropriate utilization of the same media sources is needed to counteract V-HR and enhance awareness about the necessity and lifesaving benefits of vaccination.","[Cag, Yakup] Univ Hlth Sci, Kartal Dr Lufti Kirdar Training & Res Hosp, Dept Pediat, Istanbul, Turkey","Cag, Y (corresponding author), Saglik Bilimleri Univ, Kartal Dr Lufti Kirdar Egitim & Arastirma Hastane, Pediat Klin, TR-34890 Istanbul, Turkey.",yakupcag@hotmail.com,,,,,,21,0,0,7,7,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",1305-7707,1305-7693,,J PEDIAT INF DIS-GER,J.

A common countermeasure against cyber-epidemics is to disable a small subset of suspected social connections or accounts to effectively contain the epidemics. An example is the recent shutdown of 125,000 ISIS-related Twitter accounts. Despite many proposed methods to identify such a subset, none are scalable enough to provide high-quality solutions in nowadays' billion-size networks. To this end, we investigate the Spread Interdiction problems that seek the most effective links (or nodes) for removal under the well-known Linear Threshold model. We propose novel CPU-GPU methods that scale to networks with billions of edges, yet possess rigorous theoretical guarantee on the solution quality. At the core of our methods is an O(1)-space out-of-core algorithm to generate a new type of random walks, called Hitting Self-avoiding Walks (HSAWs). Such a low memory requirement enables handling of big networks and, more importantly, hiding latency via scheduling of millions of threads on GPUs. Comprehensive experiments on real-world networks show that our algorithms provide much higher quality solutions and are several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the art. Comparing to the (single-core) CPU counterpart, our GPU implementations achieve significant speedup factors up to 177x on a single GPU and 338x on a GPU pair.","[Nguyen, Hung T.; Cano, Alberto; Dinh, Thang N.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Tam Vu] Univ Colorado, Dept Comp Sci, Boulder, CO 80309 USA","Cano, A (corresponding author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",hungnt@vcu.edu; acano@vcu.edu; tam.vu@colorado.edu; tndinh@vcu.edu,"Cano, Alberto/K-4889-2014","Cano, Alberto/0000-0001-9027-298X",,,,37,3,3,4,4,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1041-4347,1558-2191,,IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN,IEEE Trans.

However, researchers have rarely investigated their diffusion in non-western contexts. This study aims to systematically examine the content and network structure of rumor-related discussions around genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on Chinese social media. Design/methodology/approach This study identified 21,837 rumor-related posts of GMOs on Weibo, one of China's most popular social media platforms. An approach combining social network analysis and content analysis was employed to classify user attitudes toward rumors, measure the level of homophily of their attitudes and examine the nature of their interactions. Findings Though a certain level of homophily existed in the interaction networks, referring to the observed echo chamber effect, Weibo also served as a public forum for GMO discussions in which cross-cutting ties between communities existed. A considerable amount of interactions emerged between the pro- and anti-GMO camps, and most of them involved providing or requesting information, which could mitigate the likelihood of opinion polarization. Moreover, this study revealed the declining role of traditional opinion leaders and pointed toward the need for alternative strategies for efficient fact-checking. Originality/value In general, the findings of this study suggested that microblogging platforms such as Weibo can function as public forums for discussing GMOs that expose users to ideologically cross-cutting viewpoints. This study stands to provide important insights into the viral processes of scientific rumors on social media.","[Wang, Xiaohui; Song, Yunya] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Journalism, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Song, YY (corresponding author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Journalism, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",vincentwx@hkbu.edu.hk; yunyasong@hkbu.edu.hk,,"wang, xiaohui/0000-0003-2126-1712",Start-up Grant Tier 2 at Hong Kong Baptist University [RC-SGT2/18-19/COMM/001]; Initiation Grant at Hong Kong Baptist University [RC-FNRA-IG-18-19-04]; Interdisciplinary Research Clusters Matching Scheme at Hong Kong Baptist University [IRCMS/19-20/D04]; AI and Media Research Lab at Hong Kong Baptist University [SDF17-1013-P01],"This work is supported in part by the Start-up Grant Tier 2 (RC-SGT2/18-19/COMM/001), the Initiation Grant (RC-FNRA-IG-18-19-04), the Interdisciplinary Research Clusters Matching Scheme (IRCMS/19-20/D04) and the AI and Media Research Lab (SDF17-1013-P01) at Hong Kong Baptist University.",,64,1,1,26,26,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1066-2243,,,INTERNET RES,Internet Res.,OCT 5,2020,30,5,,,,,1547,1564,,10.1108/INTR-11-2019-0491,,JUN 2020,18,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications",Business & Economics; Computer Science; Telecommunications,NJ7UH,WOS:000544244500001,,,,,2020-12-18,

Social media platforms police their content in various ways. Primarily they rely on crowdsourced 'flags': users signal to the platform that a specific news item might be misleading and, if they raise enough of them, the item will be fact-checked. However, real-world data show that the most flagged news sources are also the most popular and-supposedly-reliable ones. In this paper, we show that this phenomenon can be explained by the unreasonable assumptions that current content policing strategies make about how the online social media environment is shaped. The most realistic assumption is that confirmation bias will prevent a user from flagging a news item if they share the same political bias as the news source producing it. We show, via agent-based simulations, that a model reproducing our current understanding of the social media environment will necessarily result in the most neutral and accurate sources receiving most flags.","[Coscia, Michele; Rossi, Luca] IT Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark","Coscia, M (corresponding author), IT Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.",mcos@itu.dk,,"Rossi, Luca/0000-0002-3629-2039",,,,37,0,0,2,2,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1742-5689,1742-5662,,J R SOC INTERFACE,J.

This includes the spread of misinformation, which has been documented within the context of the emerging COVID-19 crisis. Understanding the creation, spread and uptake of social media misinformation is of critical importance to public safety. In this descriptive study, we detail Twitter activity regarding spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and claims it increases, or boosts, immunity. Spinal manipulation is a common intervention used by many health professions, most commonly by chiropractors. There is no clinical evidence that SMT improves human immunity. Methods Social media searching software (Talkwalker Quick Search) was used to describe Twitter activity regarding SMT and improving or boosting immunity. Searches were performed for the 3 months and 12 months before March 31, 2020 using terms related to 1) SMT, 2) the professions that most often provide SMT and 3) immunity. From these searches, we determined the magnitude and time course of Twitter activity then coded this activity into content that promoted or refuted a SMT/immunity link. Content themes, high-influence users and user demographics were then stratified as either promoting or refuting this linkage. Results Twitter misinformation regarding a SMT/immunity link increased dramatically during the onset of the COVID crisis. Activity levels (number of tweets) and engagement scores (likes + retweets) were roughly equal between content promoting or refuting a SMT/immunity link, however, the potential reach (audience) of tweets refuting a SMT/immunity link was 3 times higher than those promoting a link. Users with the greatest influence on Twitter, as either promoters or refuters, were individuals, not institutions or organizations. The majority of tweets promoting a SMT/immunity link were generated in the USA while the majority of refuting tweets originated from Canada. Conclusion Twitter activity about SMT and immunity increased during the COVID-19 crisis. Results from this work have the potential to help policy makers and others understand the impact of SMT misinformation and devise strategies to mitigate its impact.","[Kawchuk, Greg] Univ Alberta, Dept Phys Therapy, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Hartvigsen, Jan; Harsted, Steen] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Sports Sci & Clin Biomech, Odense, Denmark; [Hartvigsen, Jan] Nord Inst Chiropract & Clin Biomech, Odense, Denmark; [Nim, Casper Glissmann] Univ Hosp Southern Denmark, Med Res Unit, Spinecentre Southern Denmark, Middelfart, Denmark; [Nim, Casper Glissmann] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Reg Hlth Res, Odense, Denmark; [Nyiroe, Luana] Univ Zurich, Balgrist Univ Hosp, Dept Chiropract Med, Zurich, Switzerland","Kawchuk, G (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Phys Therapy, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",greg.kawchuk@ualberta.ca,"Harsted, Steen/C-6153-2019","Harsted, Steen/0000-0002-1879-2224; Nyiro, Luana/0000-0003-2504-9719; Hartvigsen, Jan/0000-0002-5876-7410; Glissmann Nim, Casper/0000-0001-5845-2622",Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation,Funds from the Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation were used to purchase Talkwalker access.,,35,2,2,6,6,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2045-709X,,CHIROPR MAN THER,Chiropr.

The parameter Q is tuned online by a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm so that it converges to the desired value. An adaptive optical system with a prototype MFDM is setup to verify the effectiveness of the adaptive controller. The control performance is also compared with a H-infinity controller to show the improvement of the wavefront residue RMS error. The result illustrates that the proposed adaptive control method can effectively control the mirror surface for the unknown dynamic aberration correction, especially to the deterministic disturbances in adaptive optics systems.","[Wu, Zhizheng; Qian, Fanfan; Wang, Yuanyuan; Wu, Junqiu; Dziki, Merveilles] Shanghai Univ, Dept Precis Mech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhu] Univ Utrecht, Debye Inst Nanomat Sci, Utrecht, Netherlands","Wu, ZZ (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ, Dept Precis Mech Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zhizhengwu@shu.edu.cn,,"wu, zhizheng/0000-0001-5427-2528",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51675321]; Shanghai Municipal Natural Science Foundation [15ZR1415800]; Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education CommissionInnovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [14ZZ092],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51675321); Shanghai Municipal Natural Science Foundation (15ZR1415800); The Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(14ZZ092).,,38,0,0,4,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0957-4158,,,MECHATRONICS,Mechatronics,JUN,2020,68,,,,,,,,102346,10.1016/j.mechatronics.2020.102346,,,13,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical; Robotics",Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Robotics,MA4PN,WOS:000541897200001,,,,,2020-12-18,

The working group 'Drugs and COVID-19' was composed of a scientific council, an editorial team, and experts in the field. The first questions were posted online during the first evening of home-confinement in France, March 17, 2020. Six weeks later, 140 Q&As have been posted. Questions on the controversial use of hydroxychloroquine and to a lesser extent concerning azithromycin have been the most consulted Q&As. Q&As have been consulted 226 014 times in 41 days. This large visibility was obtained through an early communication on Twitter, Facebook, traditional print, and web media. In addition, an early communication through the French Ministry of Health and the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety ANSM had a large impact in terms of daily number of views. There is a pressing need to sustain a public drug information service combining the expertise of scholarly pharmacology societies, pharmacovigilance network, and the Ministry of Health to quickly provide understandable, clear, expert answers to the general population's concerns regarding COVID-19 and drug use and to counter fake news.","[Larrouquere, Louis; Gabin, Manon; Poingt, Emmanuelle; Mouffak, Amelle; Hlavaty, Alex; Lepelley, Marion; Khouri, Charles; Bellier, Alexandre; Bedouch, Pierrick; Roustit, Matthieu; Cracowski, Jean-Luc] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CHU Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France; [Alexandre, Joachim] Univ Caen Normandie, CHU Caen Normandie, Caen, France; [Bertoletti, Laurent; Laporte, Silvy] Univ St Etienne, CHU St Etienne, St Etienne, France; [Bordet, Regis] Univ Lille, CHU Lille, Lille, France; [Bouhanick, Beatrice] Univ Toulouse, CHU Toulouse, Toulouse, France; [Jonville-Bera, Annie-Pierre] Univ Tours, CHU Tours, Tours, France; [Le Jeunne, Claire] Univ Paris, APHP, Paris, France; [Letinier, Louis; Molimard, Mathieu] Univ Bordeaux, CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France; [Micallef, Joelle] Aix Marseille Univ, Hop Univ Marseille APHM, Marseille, France; [Naudet, Florian] Univ Rennes, CHU Rennes, Rennes, France; [Richard, Vincent] Univ Rouen, CHU Rouen, Rouen, France","Cracowski, JL (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, CHU Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France.",Jean-Luc.Cracowski@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,"Alexandre, Joachim/ABE-2490-2020; Alexandre, Joachim/ABE-6176-2020; Bedouch, Pierrick/AAI-5093-2020","Alexandre, Joachim/0000-0002-9197-8404; Bedouch, Pierrick/0000-0003-2245-0160; Letinier, Louis/0000-0001-5082-4866",Agence Nationale de Securite du Medicament et des Produits de Sante Funding Source: Medline,,,18,8,8,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0767-3981,1472-8206,,FUND CLIN PHARMACOL,Fundam.

This study uses an experimental design on a national sample to test two features of user-based correction strategies on Instagram for a divisive issue on which misinformation abounds: the issue of climate change. First, we unite the inoculation and correction literature to test the efficacy of prebunking corrections that come before exposure to the misinformation versus debunking strategies that occur after exposure. Second, we compare fact-focused corrections that provide accurate information to rebut the misinformation against logic-focused corrections that highlight the rhetorical flaw underpinning the misinformation. Our findings suggest that these strategies intersect to reduce misperceptions. Logic-focused corrections effectively reduce misperceptions regardless of their placement before or after the misinformation, and appear to function in part by reducing perceptions of the credibility of the misinformation post. Fact-focused corrections only reduce misperceptions when they occur after the misinformation, but are seen as more credible than logic-focused corrections. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the theoretical mechanism by which correction can occur and the practical guidelines to best correct misinformation in visual social media spaces.","[Vraga, Emily K.] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Kim, Sojung Claire] George Mason Univ, Dept Commun, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Cook, John] George Mason Univ, Ctr Climate Change Commun, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Bode, Leticia] Georgetown Univ, Commun Culture & Technol Masters Program, Washington, DC USA","Vraga, EK (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, 338 Murphy Hall,206 Church St, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",ekvraga@umn.edu,,"Vraga, Emily/0000-0002-3016-3869",Department of Communication at George Mason University,"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Funding for this study was provided by the Department of Communication at George Mason University.",,61,3,3,7,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China. Methods: We conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan. Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff >= 3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff >= 3), respectively. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression. Results: Of the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2). Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1). Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent >= 2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media. Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending >= 2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults. Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults. Conclusions: The internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks. Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental health.","[Ni, Michael Y.; Leung, Candi M.

To investigate fake news during natural disasters, this mixed-methods study examines information patterns and journalistic practices of three news organizations during the 2018 Palu earthquake and tsunami. First, online observations of disaster-related fake news cases on social media provide insights into how fake news was handled by three types of news media. The results show that when fake news concerned factual scientific evidence, news organizations unanimously used the government statements to debunk disinformation. In contrast, political or religious fake news had long lifecycles of polarized debates between pro-government groups and opponents. Using the Hierarchy-of Influences Model, in-depth interviews showed that individual-level journalistic professionalism mattered when tackling fake news reports, with some local practices differing from Western journalism approaches. At the routine level, news professionals treated the government as the authority to debunk controversial, high-risk fake news by presenting news only after official clarifications, while independent media tended to present balanced reports with diverse views. Additionally, interviewees revealed that organizational policies in relation to media types greatly influenced the handling of fake news practices in Indonesian newsrooms.","[Kwanda, Febbie Austina] Natl Chengchi Univ, Coll Commun, Int Masters Program Int Commun Studies, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Trisha T.

Motivated by recent attempts in this direction, we consider the problem faced by a social-media platform that is observing the sharing actions of a sequence of rational agents and is dynamically choosing whether to conduct an inspection (i.e., a fact-check) of an article whose validity is ex ante unknown. We first characterize the agents' inspection and sharing actions and establish that, in the absence of any platform intervention, the agents' news-sharing process is prone to the proliferation of fabricated content, even when the agents are intent on sharing only truthful news. We then study the platform's inspection problem. We find that because the optimal policy is adapted to crowdsource inspection from the agents, it exhibits features that may appear a priori nonobvious; most notably, we show that the optimal inspection policy is nonmonotone in the ex ante probability that the article being shared is fake. We also investigate the effectiveness of the platform's policy in mitigating the detrimental impact of fake news on the agents' learning environment. We demonstrate that in environments characterized by a low (high) prevalence of fake news, the platform's policy is more effective when the rewards it collects from content sharing are low relative to the penalties it incurs from the sharing of fake news (when the rewards it collects from content sharing are high in absolute terms).","[Papanastasiou, Yiangos] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Papanastasiou, Y (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",yiangos@haas.berkeley.edu,"LI, DONGLIN/AAS-1210-2020",,,,,37,2,2,24,34,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",0025-1909,1526-5501,,MANAGE SCI,Manage.

There was an alarming level of public fear during the disease outbreak due toan information crisis, resulted by the government's holdback of vital information and the widespread MERS rumours on social media. By paying attention to news coverage patterns of rumours and comparing them across the outbreak period, the paper examines the following research questions: (a) Under what media frames were the MERS rumours reported by the online news? (b) Which media frame did the online news use most frequently? (c) How did the media frames change during and after the information vacuum? Methods Content analysis of news articles that covered MERS rumours during the outbreak has been conducted. Inductive open coding has been performed to investigate what reactions and media frames the news coverages have demonstrated to report the rumour propagation. Sample The article samples were retrieved for big data analysis from the Big Kinds or the Korea Integrated News Database System (), by using the search terms, MERS and SNS (Social Network Services). A total of 142 articles have been sampled. Results The paper found 7 reaction variables and categorized them into 2 risk-reporting media frames: risk-alarming frame(Anxiety, Criticisms and Damage) and risk-mitigating frame (Government, Correction, Remedies and Causes). The paper discovered that anxiety was the most frequently observed reaction variable across all phases. The paper also concluded that there has been a decrease in risk-alarming media frames and an increase in attempts to analyze causes for the rumour propagation (Causes), as the outbreak proceeds to the second phase, when the information vacuum finally ended. Conclusion By exploring a disease outbreak in which ineffective risk management and absence of official information caused significant problems, the paper underlines the need for systematic risk communication measures, endorsed by effective collaboration among political leadership, media and the public.","[Yang, Jeongwon] Syracuse Univ, Newhouse Sch Publ Commun, Dept Mass Commun, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA; [Lee, Sunhee] Ewha Womans Univ, Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, Seoul, South Korea","Lee, S (corresponding author), Ewha Womans Univ, Sch Med, Dept Prevent Med, Seoul, South Korea.",jyang97@syr.edu; lsh0270@ewha.ac.kr,,,,,,69,0,0,7,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0966-0879,1468-5973,,J CONTING CRISIS MAN,J.

Insights into how to debunk this type of misinformation can especially be crucial for public health crises. To identify corrective information strategies that increase awareness and trigger actions during infectious disease outbreaks, an online experiment (N = 700) was conducted, using a U.S. sample. After initial misinformation exposure, participants' exposure to corrective information type (simple rebuttal vs. factual elaboration) and source (government health agency vs. news media vs. social peer) was varied, including a control group without corrective information. Results show that, if corrective information is present rather than absent, incorrect beliefs based on misinformation are debunked and the exposure to factual elaboration, compared to simple rebuttal, stimulates intentions to take protective actions. Moreover, government agency and news media sources are found to be more successful in improving belief accuracy compared to social peers. The observed mediating role of crisis emotions reveals the mechanism underlying the effects of corrective information. The findings contribute to misinformation research by providing a formula for correcting the increasing spread of misinformation in times of crisis.","[van der Meer, Toni G. L.

This study aimed to examine the strengths and weaknesses of English baby-box schemes as experienced by healthcare providers and parents. Methods An independent mixed-methods evaluation was conducted via telephone interviews and online surveys with healthcare providers and parents in all 7/9 NHS regions of England where baby-box schemes were established 2016-2019. Participants responded to requests circulated electronically by NHS Research & Design Departments, and infant health organisations in England. The objectives were to identify how parents and healthcare providers understood and experienced baby-box schemes implemented in England to date, and to produce recommendations for organisations considering involvement in future schemes. Results Baby-box schemes changed over time, and were complex to run and monitor. Both parents and practitioners were misinformed about their purpose and origins. Partnerships with a commercial box-provider reduced the investment needed to run a baby-box scheme, and offered potential benefits to staff regarding engagement with families via online education and face-to-face contact around handover of boxes, but carried unforeseen costs. Of particular concern was the box-provider's access to parent personal details being promoted by NHS staff and parents' lack of awareness; the hidden costs incurred by NHS facilities of running a box-scheme; and the costs incurred by parents in accessing their 'free' box. Sixteen recommendations are proposed for healthcare providers and organisations considering commercial - health-provider baby-box partnerships in future. Conclusions Many assumptions exist about the origins and purpose of baby-boxes; this misinformation needs correcting, especially as it relates to infant death reduction and safe infant sleep. Baby-box schemes take multiple forms from those motivated by social welfare to those motivated by commercial profit. The English experience of partnership schemes between healthcare facilities and commercial box-providers reveals some success stories, along with multiple points of ambiguity, unanticipated difficulty, and concerns for infant safety.","[Ball, Helen L.; Taylor, Catherine E.] Univ Durham, Infancy & Sleep Ctr, Dept Anthropol, Durham DH1 3LE, England","Ball, HL (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Infancy & Sleep Ctr, Dept Anthropol, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",h.l.ball@dur.ac.uk,"Ball, Helen L./C-6056-2013","Ball, Helen L./0000-0003-2255-121X",,,,28,0,0,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2431,,BMC PEDIATR,BMC Pediatr.,APR 11,2020,20,1,,,,,,,154,10.1186/s12887-020-02064-2,,,11,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,LE4MM,WOS:000526693400001,32278356,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2020-12-18,

The only nuclear accident to receive a Level-7 classification on the International Nuclear Event Scale since the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster in 1986, the Fukushima event triggered global concerns and rumors regarding radiation leaks. Among the false rumors was an image, which had been described as a map of radioactive discharge emanating into the Pacific Ocean, as illustrated in the accompanying figure. In fact, this figure, depicting the wave height of the tsunami that followed, still to this date circulates on social media with the inaccurate description. Social media is ideal for spreading rumors, because it lacks censorship. Confirmation bias and filter-bubble effects further amplify the spread of unconfirmed information. Upon public outcry, independent fact-checking organizations have emerged globally, and many platforms are making efforts to fight against fake news. For example, the state-run Factually website in Singapore has been known to clarify falsehoods since its inception in May 2012, which was followed recently by the implementation of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) in October 2019. In Taiwan, the government officially created a feature on the website of the Executive Yuan (the executive branch of Taiwan's government) to identify erroneous reporting and combat the spread of fake news. Taiwan's Open Culture Foundation has also developed and introduced the well-known anti-fake fact-checking chatbot Cofacts in May 2018. The Indonesia government since 2018 has held weekly briefings on hoax news; that same year, the country revised its Criminal Code to permit the imprisonment for up to six years of anyone spreading fake news. Governments in the Asia and Oceania region, including South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, Cambodia, Malaysia, have enacted relevant laws to prevent fake news from spreading. Nonetheless, fact-checking of fake news remains daunting, and requires tremendous time and effort in terms of human investigation. Moreover, it is prone to low efficiency and inadequate coverage due to the complexity of the topics being checked, and is incapable of keeping up with the fast production and diffusion of falsehoods online. This article will review some of the latest techniques to automatically debunk fake news, many of which were initiated in the Asia and Oceania region.","[Cha, Meeyoung] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Comp, Seoul, South Korea; [Gao, Wei] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore, Singapore; [Li, Cheng-Te] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Inst Data Sci, Tainan, Taiwan; [Li, Cheng-Te] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Stat, Tainan, Taiwan","Cha, M (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Comp, Seoul, South Korea.",,,,,,,11,1,1,1,1,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA",0001-0782,1557-7317,,COMMUN ACM,Commun.

There are significant public doubts in expediency of investments in renewables in place. Our paper studies the factors related to the public opinion on renewables using a reasonable and representative sample of respondents (N = 1026) from one of the EU Member States, the Czech Republic, via a set of ordinal regression analyses with spline correction for ordinal predictors. Our results suggest that the population of the Czech Republic is split in half in its trust in renewables as a substitute to traditional energy sources. In addition, our results show that the opinions on renewables in the Czech Republic are significantly related to personal concerns on environmental protection and worries about use of nuclear energy. Moreover, we find that traditional mass media is not statistically significant, even though internet news channels and social media were statistically related to the opinions (negatively and positively, respectively). The comparison of the responses with respect to the frequency of following social media support the hypothesis of the media bubble. The empirical results indicate that public opinions on renewables are likely to be built on the information sources vulnerable to hoaxes, bubbles, and misinformation. We conclude that more media presentation on RES is needed and make some practical suggestions for the stakeholders, journalists, and relevant policymakers.","[Cabelkova, Inna; Strielkowski, Wadim] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Trade & Finance, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16500, Czech Republic; [Firsova, Irina] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Dept Mkt, Moscow 125993, Russia; [Korovushkina, Marina] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Dept Language Training, Moscow 125993, Russia","Strielkowski, W (corresponding author), Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Trade & Finance, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16500, Czech Republic.",cabelkova@pef.czu.cz; strielkowski@pef.czu.cz; IFirsova@fa.ru; MVKorovushkina@fa.ru,"Korovushkina, Marina/AAD-3112-2020; Strielkowski, Wadim/I-4374-2019","Korovushkina, Marina/0000-0002-5060-2371; Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841",,,,54,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,APR,2020,13,7,,,,,,,1742,10.3390/en13071742,,,15,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,LU3WB,WOS:000537688400211,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020-12-18,

These falsehoods were published in professional journals, presented at conferences, and distributed through internet websites and blogs. This article summarizes five examples of published misinformation regarding PAS/PA. Each case study includes: the false statements that were published in the medical, psychological, or legal professional literature; the names of the individuals who made the false statements; and the steps taken to refute the falsehoods and correct the record. The writers of the misinformation were from Sweden, Tunisia, Spain, and the United States, which illustrates the international scope of PAS/PA. In one example, the misinformation reached the U.S. House of Representatives and was almost included in a formal resolution adopted by that body. The article discusses various underlying causes of the high level of polarization in PAS/PA scholarship. The article also proposes steps that both mental health and legal writers can adopt to reduce the destructive polarization that has occurred. In general, however, clinicians, forensic practitioners, and legal professionals should remain vigilant when they read articles or listen to presentations about topics that might be considered controversial.","[Bernet, William] Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Nashville, TN 37235 USA","Bernet, W (corresponding author), Vanderbilt Univ, Sch Med, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.",william.bernet@vumc.org,,,,,,66,4,4,2,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1531-2445,1744-1617,,FAM COURT REV,Fam.

Of interest here, the sliding bubble velocity is included in a mechanistic boiling heat transfer model and it varies with the bubble volume, location of the nucleation site, generation frequency of the bubble, etc. In order to predict the sliding velocity of the bubbles generated under the various conditions, a model developed based on the physical mechanism is required. This paper presents experimental techniques and measurement results for observing vapour bubble sliding phenomena. A specially devised flexible heater was fabricated and attached on a rod in order to control the bubble generation location. With the heater and a digital image processing technique, accurate measurement of the bubble volume and velocity became facilitated. Through the experiment, the life cycles of a single bubble was clearly visualised including the birth, departure, sliding, and lift-off. The force balance model which includes the curvature effect in cylindrical coordinate was derived to predict the sliding bubble velocity in the experiment. The equation of the model was based on the balance of circumferential directional forces acting on a sliding bubble with a correction of the local liquid velocity to consider the wake generated by a preceding bubble. The force balance analysis showed that the dominant forces are the buoyancy, quasisteady drag, and added mass forces. The proposed model was validated by comparing the predicted bubble velocity with the experimental data and it predicted the bubble velocity with satisfactory accuracy. In addition, the force balance analysis found that the sliding bubble velocity correlates well with the bubble generation location when it was non-dimensionalised in a form of Froude number.

Methods. - Using agent-based models, we considered the effects of such misinformation on a norovirus outbreak, and some methods for countering the possible impacts of good and bad health advice. The work explicitly models spread of physical disease and information (both online and offline) as two separate but interacting processes. The models have multiple stochastic elements; repeat model runs were made to identify parameter values that most consistently produced the desired target baseline scenario. Next, parameters were found that most consistently led to a scenario when outbreak severity was clearly made worse by circulating poor quality disease prevention advice. Strategies to counter fake health news were tested. Results. - Reducing bad advice to 30% of total information or making at least 30% of people fully resistant to believing in and sharing bad health advice were effective thresholds to counteract the negative impacts of bad advice during a norovirus outbreak. Conclusion. - How feasible it is to achieve these targets within communication networks (online and offline) should be explored. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

And, there are a large number of malicious nodes in the network. These malicious nodes may tamper with the correct data and pass them to other nodes. The normal nodes will use the wrong data for information dissemination due to a lack of ability to verify the correctness of the messages received, resulting in the dissemination of false information on medical, social, and other networks. Auditing user attributes and behavior information to identify malicious user nodes is an important way to secure networks. In response to the user nodes audit problem, a user audit model based on attribute measurement and similarity measurement (AM-SM-UAM) is proposed. Firstly, the user attribute measurement algorithm is constructed, using a hierarchical decision model to construct a judgment matrix to analyze user attribute data. Secondly, the blog similarity measurement algorithm is constructed, evaluating the similarity of blog posts published by different users based on the improved Levenshtein distance. Finally, a user audit model based on a security degree is built, and malicious users are defined by security thresholds. Experimental results show that this model can comprehensively analyze the attribute and behavior data of users and have more accurate and stable performance in the practical application of the network platforms.","[Yang, Xiaohui; Sun, Ying] Hebei Univ, Sch Cyber Secur & Comp, Baoding 071002, Peoples R China","Yang, XH (corresponding author), Hebei Univ, Sch Cyber Secur & Comp, Baoding 071002, Peoples R China.",yxh@hbu.edu.cn; cherish.sy@foxmail.com,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0802300],This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant no. 2017YFB0802300.,,19,0,0,1,1,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1939-0114,1939-0122,,SECUR COMMUN NETW,Secur.

It refers to the ideology, norms, rules, and myths that exist in modern society in Indonesia, especially the reproduction of hoax content. Hoax refers to the logic people who live in a world of cyber media with all of its social implications. This phenomenon is a problem, and it is at the heart of the exploration of the art community in East Java Biennale. The critical social theory perspective of Gramsci's theory forms the basis of this research analysis. The qualitative research approach used a digital ethnomethodology research method focused on the online and offline social movements in the Biennale Art Community. The data collection techniques used were observation and non-active participation in the process of reproduction-related to the exhibition of Indonesian Biennale digital artworks. It was then analyzed using Gramsci's hegemony theory. The purpose of this study was to describe the process of social movements in a digital format conducted by the Indonesian Biennale when reproducing works of art to counteract the dominance and hegemony of the Hoax phenomenon in Indonesia. The benefit of this research was that it obtained a preposition of Gramsci's hegemony theory in the world of digital art as created by contemporary Indonesian Biennale artists. Digital technology has had a tremendous effect on the media industry, government, trade, informal industry sector, human resources, urban planning, services, disaster relief, health, education, religion, artistic and cultural expression, in addition to various other fields. The conclusion obtained from this research is that there is a formation of a new hegemony, a digital hegemony. This new hegemony is of particular concern for the digital artists in East Java Biennale. Through the digital format works, the artists also try to communicate their art as a form of silent resistance, protest, and criticism of the hegemony that occurs in society, referring to the ideology, norms, and myths.

When used correctly, social media is an effective tool to communicate and to share food safety news and good practices. However, there have been reports of fake food safety news shared via social media, fueling panic and resulting in a loss of revenue. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the consumers' awareness, trust, and usage of social media in communicating food safety news in Malaysia. A questionnaire divided into five sections-(i) demographics, (ii) reaction to food safety news, (iii) consumers' awareness, (iv) social media truth and level of trust, and (v) social media uses and content creation-was created and shared online. A total of 341 questionnaires were returned of which 339 surveys were valid. This study revealed that less than one-third of the study group (27.1%) knew which of the food safety news were fake. Most respondents (67.8%) were less likely to purchase the affected foods if the foods were featured in social media as problematic, although no differences were made between true and fake news and how that would influence respondents' willingness to purchase affected foods. Overall, 62% of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed about the usage of social media and its ability to prevent food poisoning cases, while more than 50% of the respondents were in total agreement that social media allow consumers to act more responsibly by sharing food safety news. Respondents tended to trust information shared by scientists (67.5%) and family members and friends (33%). Respondents would most often share the news after verifying its authenticity (46%). If respondents experienced a personal food safety issue (e.g., discovered a fly in their meal), they seldom or never took photos to post online (56.1%). It is possible that the respondents preferred to inform the food handlers and/or shop owners about the affected products rather than post the photos online. It is suggested that targeted food safety information and media literacy be provided to improve consumers' awareness and to positively influence self-verification of the food safety information before sharing. This study provides crucial insights for a range of stakeholders, particularly public authorities, food bloggers, and the public, in using social media effectively to build consumers' awareness and trust in food safety information.","[Soon, Jan Mei] Univ Cent Lancashire, Fac Hlth & Wellbeing, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England","Soon, JM (corresponding author), Univ Cent Lancashire, Fac Hlth & Wellbeing, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England.",jmsoon@uclan.ac.uk,,,,,,62,1,1,5,10,INT ASSOC FOOD PROTECTION,DES MOINES,"6200 AURORA AVE SUITE 200W, DES MOINES, IA 50322-2863 USA",0362-028X,1944-9097,,J FOOD PROTECT,J.

Once inserted, it can be difficult to correct the orientation of the implant axis, especially of a one-piece implant. Prosthetic-driven digital implant planning in combination with fully guided implant surgery can offer additional safety in such cases. Case presentation: The patient presented with a wide, edentulous interdental space extending from sites 13 to 16, which was to be restored with three one-piece zirconia implants supporting a zirconia fixed partial denture comprizing a cantilever to the mesial aspect. Digital planning based on DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) and intraoral surface data was performed to ensure optimal positioning. Guided implant placement was executed using a contra-angle handpiece with special attachments and a compatible, sleeveless drill guide. Impressions of the implants for the final restoration were acquired using an intraoral scanner. Reflection-related errors were compensated for by using the given digital abutment geometry. The DICOM and STL datasets were superimposed and used as the basis for fabricating a monolithic zirconia restoration through a subtractive milling process. The final restoration was adhesively cemented. Conclusions: By using a prosthetic-driven implant planning strategy, it was possible to place the one-piece ceramic implants without an available implant manufacturer's guide-based solution. This was accomplished using a contra-angle surgical handpiece with special attachments and a compatible drill guide. This approach is particularly recommended for the placement of one-piece implants, which otherwise require irreversible abutment grinding for the adjustment of the implant axis orientation after placement.

In this study, the rumor diffusion in the homogeneous and heterogeneous social networks has been explored, introducing the concept of an anti-rumor spreading agent as the mitigator. The study consists of four types of individuals within the population, namely, spreaders, mitigators, ignorants, and stiflers. To model the interactions among the aforesaid populations, five mathematical models have been proposed for the rumor diffusion process in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. The proposed SMIR model has been solved using Runge-Kutta fourth-order method and then the model has been extended into a fuzzy environment to deal with the inherent uncertainties. The spreading of a rumor is a socio-psychological phenomenon which may contain delay in the process. To investigate this, the SMIR model has been transformed into a delayed SMIR model. In the heterogeneous environment, the SMIR model has been extended in a small world and scale-free networks. The results obtained are analyzed in all the cases and found that mitigator plays a critical role to control the spread of rumor in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Against this backdrop, we conducted an online experiment with a diverse sample of U.S. citizens (N = 1,404) to investigate the credibility of textual versus multimodal (text-plus-visual) disinformation, and the effects of textual and multimodal fact checkers in refuting disinformation on school shootings and refugees. Our findings indicate that, irrespective of the source, multimodal disinformation is considered slightly more credible than textual disinformation. Fact checkers can help to overcome the potential harmful consequences of disinformation. We also found that fact checkers can overcome partisan and attitudinal filters - which points to the relevance of fact checking as a journalistic discipline.","[Hameleers, Michael; Powell, Thomas E.; Van Der Meer, Toni G.

The paper will examine what the professional role of Facebook is regarding its information/communication practices and then demonstrate that Facebook is essentially a media company and not merely a platform, therefore liable to the same normative responsibilities as other media companies. Design/methodology/approach Applying the dual obligation information theory (DOIT), a normative information and communication theory that applies generally to all media companies that disseminate and share information, the paper demonstrates that Facebook's role of mediating and curating the information of its users places upon it a normative editing responsibility, to ensure both the preventive detection and corrective editing of fake news, as well as other forms of misinformation disseminated on its platform. Finally, applying a philosophical model of media corruption the paper will demonstrate that Facebook's role in the Cambridge Analytica case was not only unethical but moreover, constituted media corruption. Findings The paper concludes that Facebook's media corruption illustrated in the Cambridge Analytica case is not a one-off case but the result of a systemic and inherent conflict of interest between its business model of selling users' information to advertisers and its normative media role rendering the conflict of interest between those two roles conducive to media corruption. Originality/value The paper's originality is twofold. It demonstrates that Facebook is a media company normatively accountable on the basis of an original theory the DOIT and moreover, on the basis of an original media corruption theory its actions in the Cambridge Analytica case constituted media corruption.","[Spence, Edward Howlett] Univ Sydney, Sch Philosoph & Hist Inquiry, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Spence, Edward Howlett] Eindhoven Univ, 4TU, Ctr Eth & Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands","Spence, EH (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Philosoph & Hist Inquiry, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Spence, EH (corresponding author), Eindhoven Univ, 4TU, Ctr Eth & Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",edward.spence@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,20,0,0,1,5,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1477-996X,1758-8871,,J INF COMMUN ETHICS,J.

However, little is known about experts' participation in online communities, or effective ways to prepare them for public engagement. Here, we explored these issues with experts who voluntarily engage with publics on social media, to understand their public engagement practices. Stimulated recall interviews were conducted with 20 experts who participate in question-and-answer Facebook groups dedicated to vaccines and nutrition. The findings suggest that experts employ diverse considerations in their outreach, partly to establish epistemic trustworthiness. These can be grouped into three goals and two constraints: countering misinformation, establishing benevolence, and establishing competence while maintaining integrity and clarity. Empathic failure and burnout both emerged as factors that impair establishing benevolence. We discuss implications for community-level science literacy and for preparing scientists for bounded engagement with publics.","[Sharon, Aviv J.; Baram-Tsabari, Ayelet] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Educ Sci & Technol, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel","Sharon, AJ (corresponding author), Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Educ Sci & Technol, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel.",aviv.sharon@gmail.com,,"Sharon, Aviv/0000-0003-1326-2168; Baram-Tsabari, Ayelet/0000-0002-8123-5519",I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee; Israel Science Foundation (ISF)Israel Science Foundation [1716/12]; ISFIsrael Science Foundation [1599/15]; Irwin and Joan Jacobs Fellowship,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the I-CORE Program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee and the Israel Science Foundation (ISF) grant 1716/12, as well as by ISF grant 1599/15 and the Irwin and Joan Jacobs Fellowship.",,51,1,1,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0963-6625,1361-6609,,PUBLIC UNDERST SCI,Public Underst.

The spread of non-scientific information through social media platforms such as Twitter has potential to cause damaging consequences. Situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic provides a favourable environment for misinformation to thrive. The upcoming 5G technology is one of the recent victims of misinformation and fake news and has been plagued with misinformation about the effects of its radiation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories linking the cause of the pandemic to 5G technology have resonated with a section of people leading to outcomes such as destructive attacks on 5G towers. The analysis of the social network data can help to understand the nature of the information being spread and identify the commonly occurring themes in the information. The natural language processing (NLP) and the statistical analysis of the social network data can empower policymakers to understand the misinformation being spread and develop targeted strategies to counter the misinformation. In this paper, NLP based analysis of tweets linking COVID-19 to 5G is presented. NLP models including Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), sentiment analysis (SA) and social network analysis (SNA) were applied for the analysis of the tweets and identification of topics. An understanding of the topic frequencies, the inter-relationships between topics and geographical occurrence of the tweets allows identifying agencies and patterns in the spread of misinformation and equips policymakers with knowledge to devise counter-strategies.","[Bahja, Mohammed] Univ Birmingham, Coll Engn & Phys Sci EPS, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Safdar, Ghazanfar Ali] Univ Bedfordshire, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Luton LU1 3JU, Beds, England","Safdar, GA (corresponding author), Univ Bedfordshire, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Luton LU1 3JU, Beds, England.",ghazanfar.safdar@beds.ac.uk,,,,,,39,0,0,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,209127,209137,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3039168,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,OY7KI,WOS:000594421800001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020-12-18,

Social networks, in echo-chamber mode, reproduce the government's discourse of confusion and lie and favor a climate of destabilizing disinformation in democracies. In parallel, digital audiences are installed as prosumers of the political hoax on Twitter, and a tendency of the media to combat fake news is seen. Methodology: The main objective is to know which disinformation brands identify the leader's message, what role audiences play in the production and dissemination of the false, and what verification processes are carried out by fact-checking agencies (Pagella Politica, Maldito Bulo, Full Fact, and PolitiFact) and the media (La Repubblica, El Pais, The Guardian and The New York Times) in favor of the reliability of the public in a situation of maximum risk. On a sample composed of tweets published by the presidents of government (n = 272), news related to Covid-19 (n1 = 4,543), and hoaxes detected on Twitter (n1 = 200), we designed a methodology for quantitative-qualitative content analysis and critical analysis of political discourse. SPSS applied statistics software is used. Results, Discussion, and conclusions: The results reveal the prominence of a fallacious political language, which favors the production of hoaxes on the Internet and requires the effectiveness of the fact-checking system of international agencies and the media, to combat the false, always, and more if possible in moments of an unprecedented health pandemic.","[Perez-Curiel, Concha] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Velasco Molpeceres, Ana Maria] Univ Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain","Perez-Curiel, C (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",cperez1@us.es; anamaria.velasco.molpeceres@uva.es,,,,,,109,0,0,0,0,LABORATORIO TECNOLOGIAS INFORMACION & NUEVOS ANALISIS COMUNICACION SOCIAL,TENERIFE,"PIRAMIDE CAMPUS GUAJARA, LA LAGUNA, TENERIFE, 38200, SPAIN",1138-5820,,,REV LAT COMUN SOC,Rev.

Method: A content analysis was developed with 371 fake news, previously verified by fact-checkers. After the intercoder test, it was proceeded to classify disinformation according to their type, intentionality, the main topic addressed, networks where they circulated, deception technique, country of origin, transnational character, among other variables. Results: The most common intent of fake news was ideological, associated with issues such as false announcements by governments, organizations, or public figures, as well as with false context elaboration technique. A quarter of the hoaxes analyzed were repeated in several countries, mainly promoting false cures with fabricated content as a deception technique. Discussion and Conclusions: Disinformation is a manipulation and filtering phenomenon based on ideological and emotional coincidence shared by those who circulate them.

Acknowledging the power that social media had in influencing voters, The Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 (CMA) was mobilised to hunt dissenters, where some cases resulted in successful prosecution. Despite the drastic move taken to enact the Anti-Fake News Act 2018 one month before the election, the previous government failed to convince the public that fake news was grave threats to society. Instead, the above initiative may have contributed to BN's painful defeat against the inexperienced PH. After the election, PH faced similar issues of having to deal with a plethora of fake news online and the 'gun' had now turned towards them. The PH Ministers had difficult times correcting misstatements issued through social media which was flooded with sarcastic trolls, some of which may amount to illegal content. Through a qualitative method, this article assesses how social media influenced the landscape of 14th GE. Consequently, international and national legal frameworks have been developed to combat the dissemination of fake news online, as analysed in the second part of this paper. The third part further examines how popular social media platforms provide countermeasures in dealing with fake news and how far legal frameworks correspond to the practices of service providers. It is hypothesised that in time, the PH coalition should have turned towards censoring the internet as done by the previous BN government due to the emerging threat of online fake news all over the world.","[Daud, Mahyuddin] Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Ahmad Ibrahim Kulliyyah Laws, Gombak, Malaysia","Daud, M (corresponding author), Int Islamic Univ Malaysia, Ahmad Ibrahim Kulliyyah Laws, Gombak, Malaysia.",mahyuddin@iium.edu.my,,,"Ministry of Higher Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia; International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) [FRGS17-018-0584, IRAGS18-011-0012]",This paper is funded by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia and International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS17-018-0584) and IIUM Research Acculturation Grant Scheme (IRAGS18-011-0012).,,36,0,0,0,0,"INT ISLAMIC UNIV MALAYSIA, PRESS RESEARCH MANAGEMENT CENTER",KUALA LUMPUR,"PO BOX 10, KUALA LUMPUR, 50728, MALAYSIA",0128-2530,2289-7852,,IIUM LAW J,IIUM Law J.,,2020,28,,,,SI,,303,324,,,,,22,Law,Government & Law,OI7PV,WOS:000583466700003,,,,,2020-12-18,

Irresponsible use of social media has resulted in social vices such as violence, terrorism, child pornography and a myriad of other social ills. To counter the social media-induced threats, most nations have resorted to strict regulatory frameworks that criminalise and penalise some of the social media actions that are viewed as threats to national security. This paper, which is largely based on a literature and documentary survey, explores the threats posed by social media in Zimbabwe. The paper also evaluates the regulatory framework for control of the social media threats in Zimbabwe. The paper reveals that social media platforms have been used to instigate violent protests, to issue subversive statements and to spread fake news, causing fear and despondency amongst citizens. Social media platforms have also been used to facilitate other crimes such as human trafficking and distribution of pornographic material. While several existing statutes have been invoked in the face of these threats, the absence of a specific law to deal with social media threats militates against the current legal framework.","[Mugari, Ishmael] Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Bindura, Zimbabwe","Mugari, I (corresponding author), Bindura Univ Sci Educ, Bindura, Zimbabwe.",ishiemugari@gmail.com,,,,,,48,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-1886,,,COGENT SOC SCI,Cogent Soc.

However, they have also become a fertile ground for the spread of false information, particularly regarding the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Best described as an infodemic, there is a great need, now more than ever, for scientific fact-checking and misinformation detection regarding the dangers posed by these tools with regards to COVID-19. In this article, we analyze the credibility of information shared on Twitter pertaining the COVID-19 pandemic. For our analysis, we propose an ensemble-learning-based framework for verifying the credibility of a vast number of tweets. In particular, we carry out analyses of a large dataset of tweets conveying information regarding COVID-19. In our approach, we classify the information into two categories: credible or non-credible. Our classifications of tweet credibility are based on various features, including tweet- and user-level features. We conduct multiple experiments on the collected and labeled dataset. The results obtained with the proposed framework reveal high accuracy in detecting credible and non-credible tweets containing COVID-19 information.","[Al-Rakhami, Mabrook S.; Al-Amri, Atif M.] King Saud Univ, Res Chair Pervas & Mobile Comp, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Rakhami, Mabrook S.] King Saud Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Informat Syst Dept, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia; [Al-Amri, Atif M.] King Saud Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Software Engn Dept, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia","Al-Rakhami, MS (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Res Chair Pervas & Mobile Comp, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia.; Al-Rakhami, MS (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Informat Syst Dept, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia.",malrakhami@ksu.edu.sa,,"Al-Rakhami, Mabrook/0000-0001-5343-8370","Deanship of Scientific Research, Research Chair of Pervasive and Mobile Computing, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research, Research Chair of Pervasive and Mobile Computing, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",,49,1,1,2,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,155961,155970,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3019600,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,NJ6BJ,WOS:000566126900001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020-12-18,

Hence, the purpose of this study is to shed light on the effectiveness of the crisis response strategies of denial and attack in addressing rumors about consumer privacy when non-profit organizations are targeted on social media. Design/methodology/approach To test the hypotheses, a 2 (response type: denial vs attack) x 2 (privacy concerns: low vs high), between-group online experiment was conducted via Qualtrics. Findings The results indicated that one's involvement level in the issue determines the effectiveness of the crisis response strategy. Data showed that attacking the source of fake news (as a crisis response) reduces the message's credibility more than denying fake news. Furthermore, highly involved individuals are more likely to centrally process information and develop positive supportive intentions toward the affected non-profit brand. High issue involvement also predicted organizational and response credibility. Conversely, an attack rebuttal message increased the credibility of the circulated malicious rumors for low involved individuals. Research limitations/implications The findings suggest that issue involvement plays a key role in message perceptions of false information regarding consumer privacy in social media. Practical implications Practically, this study offers insights for organizations that are developing response strategies in the current environment of fake news. Findings from this study suggest that organizations need to consider the degree to which audiences are currently involved in an issue before deciding how aggressively to respond to perpetrators of fake news. Originality/value The present study examines the intersection of fake news and crisis management in the non-profit sector, with an emphasis on various response strategies and issue involvement. This is one of the first attempts to experimentally investigate how social media strategies can defend and protect non-profit reputation in the fake news era.","[Vafeiadis, Michail] Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, Publ Relat, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Bortree, Denise S.; Diddi, Pratiti] Penn State Univ, Donald P Bellisario Coll Commun, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Buckley, Christen] Penn State Univ, Donald P Bellisario Coll Commun, Media Studies Program, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Xiao, Anli] Texas A&M Univ, Corpus Christi, TX USA","Vafeiadis, M (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Commun & Journalism, Publ Relat, Auburn, AL 36849 USA.",mzv0042@auburn.edu,,,Arthur W.

Many cases were subsequently reported in other cities, which has aroused strong reverberations on the Internet and social media around the world. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the reaction of global Internet users to the outbreak of COVID-19 by evaluating the possibility of using Internet monitoring as an instrument in handling communicable diseases and responding to public health emergencies. Methods: The disease-related data were retrieved from China's National Health Commission (CNHC) and World Health Organization (WHO) from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Daily Google Trends (GT) and daily Baidu Attention Index (BAI) for the keyword Coronavirus were collected from their official websites. Rumors which occurred in the course of this outbreak were mined from Chinese National Platform to Refute Rumors (CNPRR) and Tencent Platform to Refute Rumors (TPRR). Kendall's Tau-B rank test was applied to check the bivariate correlation among the two indexes mentioned above, epidemic trends, and rumors. Results: After the outbreak of COVID-19, both daily BAI and daily GT increased rapidly and remained at a high level, this process lasted about 10 days. When major events occurred, daily BAI, daily GT, and the number of rumors simultaneously reached new peaks. Our study indicates that these indexes and rumors are statistically related to disease-related indicators. Information symmetry was also found to help significantly eliminate the false news and to prevent rumors from spreading across social media through the epidemic outbreak. Conclusion: Compared to traditional methods, Internet monitoring could be particularly efficient and economical in the prevention and control of epidemic and rumors by reflecting public attention and attitude, especially in the early period of an outbreak.","[Xie, Tiantian] Paris Descartes Univ, Ctr Rech Liens Sociaux CERLIS, Paris, France; [Tang, Tao] South China Agr Univ, Inst New Rural Dev, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Jun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Int Relat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Jun] Curtin Univ, Sch Management, Perth, WA, Australia","Xie, TT (corresponding author), Paris Descartes Univ, Ctr Rech Liens Sociaux CERLIS, Paris, France.",tiantian.xie@etu.parisdescartes.fr,,,CHINA SCHOLARSHIP COUNCILChina Scholarship Council [201708070092],"This research was funded by CHINA SCHOLARSHIP COUNCIL, grant number 201708070092.",,50,0,0,6,6,DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD,ALBANY,"PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND",,1179-1594,,RISK MANAG HEALTHC P,RISK MANAG.

Hence the anti-vax community looks better positioned to attract fresh support going forward than the pro-vax community. This is concerning since a widespread lack of adoption of a COVID-19 vaccine will mean the world falls short of providing herd immunity, leaving countries open to future COVID-19 resurgences. We provide a mechanistic model that interprets these results and could help in assessing the likely efficacy of intervention strategies.

In terms of material morphology, some basic issues will be addressed when a two-dimensional layered crystal is shaped into a one-dimensional (1D) geometry due to size effect; these include the space-confined transport in a plane, which leads to dramatic changes in electronic, optical, and thermal properties. These novel 1D nanostructures with unique properties are an optimal choice for fabricating next-generation integrated circuits and functional devices within the nanometer scale such as gate-all-around field-effect transistors, single-electron transistors, chemical sensors, and THz detectors. As one of the high-mobility 2D semiconductor, 1D high-quality Bi2O2Se nanoribbons could be promising for applications in high-performance transistors; however, their synthesis has not been completely developed yet. In our study, we report on the facile growth of Bi2O2Se nanoribbons on mica substrates via a bismuth-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. The preparation of Bi2O2Se nanoribbons is based on a previous work that emphasized on the oxidation of Bi2Se3 in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system and the use of bismuth (Bi) particles as the precursor of Bi catalysis. The morphology, composition, and structure of the as-grown Bi2O2Se nanoribbons were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as other methods. For a Bi mediated VLS growth process, the growth of Bi2O2Se nanoribbons can be self-assembled; further, in this process, as-grown epitaxial Bi2O2Se nanoribbons are free-standing with out-of-plane morphology on the mica substrate. Additionally, combining the spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscope (ACTEM) and selected electron diffraction (SAED) methods, we discovered that the as-synthesized Bi2O2Se nanoribbons were single crystalline with high quality. We further investigated the controllable growth for domain size by optimizing the growth temperature of the Bi2O2Se nanoribbons. As-synthesized single-crystal Bi2O2Se nanoribbons have widths in the range of 100 nm to 20 mu m and lengths in the sub-millimeter range. By employing a polymer poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) assisted clean transfer method with the assistance of deionized water, the Bi2O2Se nanoribbons can be easily transferred onto a SiO2/Si substrate. Fabricated into the top-gated field-effect device, the Bi2O2Se nanoribbon sample (transferred to the SiO2/Si substrate) exhibited high electronic performances; these included a high electron mobility of similar to 220 cm(2).V-1.s(-1) at room temperature, good switching behavior with on/off ratio of >10(6), and high on current density of similar to 42 mu A.mu m(-1) at a channel length of 10 mu m. Therefore, Bi2O2Se nanoribbons are expected to be a promising materials for building high-performance transistors in the future.","[Tan, Congwei; Yu, Mengshi; Xu, Shipu; Wu, Jinxiong; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Cong; Zhang, Yichi; Tu, Teng; Li, Tianran; Peng, Hailin] Peking Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing Sci & Engn Ctr Nanocarbons, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci,Ctr Nanochem, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Tan, Congwei; Peng, Hailin] Peking Univ, Acad Adv Interdisciplinary Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Chen, Shulin; Gao, Peng] Peking Univ, Int Ctr Quantum Mat, Sch Phys, Electron Microscopy Lab, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Peng, HL (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Chem & Mol Engn, Beijing Sci & Engn Ctr Nanocarbons, Beijing Natl Lab Mol Sci,Ctr Nanochem, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.; Peng, HL (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Acad Adv Interdisciplinary Studies, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",hlpeng@pku.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21733001, 21525310]","The project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21733001, 21525310).",,33,0,0,34,36,PEKING UNIV PRESS,BEIJING,"PEKING UNIV, CHEMISTRY BUILDING, BEIJING 100871, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-6818,,,ACTA PHYS-CHIM SIN,Acta Phys.-Chim.

Here, so-called 'fake news' are of focus. These are considered problematic, particularly in a high-choice media environment as users tend to show selective behaviour. Much research has demonstrated this selective exposure approach, which has roots in the Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (Festinger, 1957). However, research on the processes of coping with dissonance is still considered sparse. In particular, communication scholars have overlooked emotional states and negotiations. This article analyses the affects that are aroused when users are confronted with opinion-challenging disinformation and how they (emotionally) cope by using different strategies for online information. For this, we used the context of climate change that is widely accepted in Germany. The innovative research design included pre- and post-survey research, stimulus exposure (denying 'fake news'), observations, and retrospective interviews (n = 50). Through this, we find that perceptions and coping strategies vary individually and that overt behaviour, such as searching for counter-arguments, should be seen against the background of individual ideas and motivations, such as believing in an easy rejection of arguments. Confirming neuroscientific findings, participants felt relieved and satisfied once they were able to dissolve their dissonant state and negative arousal. Dissatisfaction and frustration were expressed if this had not been accomplished.","[Taddicken, Monika; Wolff, Laura] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Dept Commun & Media Sci, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany","Taddicken, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Dept Commun & Media Sci, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany.",m.taddicken@tu-braunschweig.de; laura.wolff@tu-braunschweig.de,,,German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG); Open Access Publication Funds of the Technische Universitat Braunschweig,"This study was conducted in cooperation with Dr. Lars Guenther (University of Hamburg, Germany) and Dr. Arne Zillich (Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany).

The precondition of effectively preventing and treating food safety problems lies in discovering the factors that influence the spreading of rumors. In this exploratory study, we investigate the factors that influence the willingness of Chinese WeChat users to forward food-safety rumors from the perspective of rumor audience. We first construct a theoretical model and put forward certain hypotheses relating variables such as rumor-content credibility, source credibility, and audience's quality of rational criticism that influences the willingness to forward food-safety rumors. The empirical results show that WeChat food-safety rumors are characterized by obvious narrative features, dependence on professional sources, and highly realistic resonance. Stronger altruistic motive, content credibility, and source credibility lead to stronger audience willingness to forward rumors. However, the government and other authorities are generally viewed as ineffectively coping with the spread of such online rumors. This study's findings suggest several ways to improve their counterrumor efforts on social media.","[Seah, Shuo] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Weimann, Gabriel] Univ Haifa, Haifa, Israel","Seah, S (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",2013210080@hust.edu.cn; weimann@com.haifa.ac.il,,,,,,49,0,0,8,13,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

Study design: Qualitative content analysis. Methods: All pages that inform and educate parents regarding childhood vaccination were downloaded and analyzed according to evidence-informed risk communication metrics. Results: A total of 32 webpages, 14 videos, and two infographics were included in the analysis. The following were the most frequent risk communication approaches: debunking common misconceptions about vaccination' or `answering common questions about vaccines.' Harm and benefit information focused primarily on the risks of vaccine- preventable diseases and the risks of adverse events after immunization. Most materials used qualitative terminology to describe the risk (e.g., vaccines are among the safest tools, adverse events are rare). Very few materials provided numeric likelihood of harms and benefits. When numeric information was stated, they were only presenting the risks of the diseases or number of cases in an outbreak. The approaches used to debunk misconceptions generally focused on the myth itself rather than the correct information. Few materials used visual aids (e.g., graphics, pictures, icons arrays, etc.) to convey important information. Conclusions: It is often assumed that misinformation and rumors about vaccination found online is a leading cause of the increase in vaccine hesitancy. Existing communication materials could be improved to better align with best practices in risk communication. Given the availability of confusing and conflicting vaccine narratives, it is crucial that authoritative communication materials aim to build trust and support informed choices about vaccination.

Experts build valuable brands, accumulate notoriety, and piece together careers by selling theorizations of algorithmic visibility on YouTube to aspiring and established creators. They function as intermediaries between sanctioned YouTube industries and the agency of cultural producers. Expertise is developed through research, strategies, and theories to help content creators mitigate platform-specific risks, particularly the risk of algorithmic invisibility. Experts develop entrepreneurial self-brands and position themselves as YouTube's adversaries, performing experiments ostensibly to reveal or translate hidden algorithmic signals or correct misleading information. However, ultimately, they teach creators to be complicit with YouTube's organizational strategies and business models. Studying algorithmic experts reveals insights into how new media producers negotiate platform visibility, but also speaks to long-standing questions about how the management of risk in cultural industries shapes symbolic production. I draw on a 3-year ethnography of YouTube industries to illustrate how experts interpret and instruct in how to become algorithmically (and advertiser) compliant on YouTube. In addition, I highlight their broader role as de facto producers and gatekeepers for aspiring and existing content producers. Meritocratic logic flows through experts' outputs-meaning expertise is limited to individualized and patchwork solutions that do not address the significant socio-economic inequalities that are still inherent on social media platforms.","[Bishop, Sophie] Kings Coll London, Dept Digital Humanities, London WC2R 2LS, England","Bishop, S (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Digital Humanities, London WC2R 2LS, England.",sophie.bishop@kcl.ac.uk,,"Bishop, Sophie/0000-0003-1028-8821",,,,63,2,2,1,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Various tools that use a BIM model for automatic quantity take-off as basis for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) have been developed recently. This paper describes the first application of such a BIM-LCA tool to evaluate the embodied global warming potential (GWP) throughout the whole design process of a real building. 34 states of the BIM model are analysed weekly. The results show that the embodied GWP during the design phase is twice as high as for the final building. These changes can be mainly attributed to the designers' approach of using placeholder materials that are refined later, besides other reasons. As such, the embodied GWP is highly overestimated and a BIM-based environmental assessment during the design process could be misleading and counterproductive.

In our paper, we propose a multi-state reinforcement diffusion model for rumor spreading, in which the reinforcement mechanism is introduced to depict individual willingness towards rumor spreading. Multiple intermediate states are introduced to characterize the process that an individual's diffusion willingness is enhanced step by step. We study the rumor spreading process with the proposed reinforcement diffusion mechanism on two typical networks. The outbreak thresholds of rumor spreading on both two networks are obtained. Numerical simulations and Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to illustrate the spreading process and verify the correctness of theoretical results. We believe that our work will shed some light on understanding how human sociality affects the rumor spreading on online social networks.","[Xu, Yuan] Minzu Univ China, Coll Literature & Journalism, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yuan] Yangtze Univ, Liberal Arts Coll, Jingzhou 434023, Peoples R China; [Mei, Renjie; Yang, Yujie; Kong, Zhengmin] Wuhan Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China","Kong, ZM (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",zmkong@whu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61801518, 61873194]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2017CFB661]",This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61801518 and No. 61873194) and Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (No. 2017CFB661).,,25,0,0,4,4,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-9120,1687-9139,,ADV MATH PHYS,Adv.

Especially pernicious advice could be classified as fake news: manufactured with no respect for accuracy and often integrated with emotive or conspiracy-framed narratives. We built an agent-based model that simulated separate but linked circulating contagious disease and sharing of health advice (classified as useful or harmful). Such advice has potential to influence human risk-taking behavior and therefore the risk of acquiring infection, especially as people are more likely in observed social networks to share bad advice. We test strategies proposed in the recent literature for countering misinformation. Reducing harmful advice from 50% to 40% of circulating information, or making at least 20% of the population unable to share or believe harmful advice, mitigated the influence of bad advice in the disease outbreak outcomes. How feasible it is to try to make people immune to misinformation or control spread of harmful advice should be explored.","[Brainard, Julii; Hunter, Paul R.] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich, Norfolk, England","Brainard, J (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, UEA Plain, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",j.brainard@uea.ac.uk,"Hunter, Paul R/A-7172-2008","Hunter, Paul R/0000-0002-5608-6144; Brainard, Julii/0000-0002-5272-7995",NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Emergency Preparedness and Response; NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Gastrointestinal Infections; PHE,This work was supported by the NIHR Health Protection Research Units in Emergency Preparedness and Response and Gastrointestinal Infections in partnership with PHE.,,78,3,3,7,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0037-5497,1741-3133,,SIMUL-T SOC MOD SIM,Simul.-Trans.

While previous research on online disinformation has focused on the individual level, the current study aims to shed light on cross-national differences. It compares online disinformation re-published by fact checkers from four Western democracies (the US, the UK, Germany, and Austria). The findings reveal significant differences between English-speaking and German-speaking countries. In the US and the UK, the largest shares of partisan disinformation are found, while in Germany and Austria sensationalist stories prevail. Moreover, in English-speaking countries, disinformation frequently attacks political actors, whereas in German-speaking countries, immigrants are most frequently targeted. Across all of the countries, topics of false stories strongly mirror national news agendas. Based on these results, the paper argues that online disinformation is not only a technology-driven phenomenon but also shaped by national information environments.","[Humprecht, Edda] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Andreas St 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland","Humprecht, E (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Andreas St 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",edda.humprecht@uzh.ch,,,,,,57,6,6,5,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

The current correction of chin deficiency mostly relies on genioplasty surgery involving osteotomy. To avoid osteotomy, one possible alternative is to enhance bone growth at the mental protuberance area with cell sheet transplantation. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of this approach in a pig model. Materials and Methods Five 4-month-old pigs were included for mandibular bone marrow aspiration and MSC isolation. Triple-layer MSC sheets were then fabricated and utilized using culture-expanded MSCs. Four weeks after bone marrow aspiration, subperiosteal pockets were created on the labial symphyseal surface, followed by transplantation of autogenous MSC sheets to one randomly chosen side with the other side (control) receiving no transplantation. Six weeks after the surgery, the pigs were euthanized and the specimens from both sides were collected for computed tomography (CT) and histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Measurements between the experimental and control sides were compared using paired t tests. Results MSC sheet fabrication and transplantation were reliably conducted. The labial cortical bone thickness increased significantly with MSC sheet transplantation by an average of 2 mm (p = 0.0001). The average measurements of mineral apposition rate and cell proliferation at the cell sheet side tended to be higher than the control side although the differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1-0.2). Tissue mineral density measurements from CT images and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) measurements from histologic images were identical between the two sides (p > 0.5). Conclusion These data provide a proof of concept that autologous MSC sheets may be transplanted to the subperiosteal region of the mandibular symphysis to stimulate local surface bone growth.

The government has appealed to China to fund large-scale projects in the transport sector, and as a consequence of this, construction firms from China have emerged as significant employers in the country. While the Kenyan government contends with the ongoing burden of youth unemployment, it must also reconcile the ambiguities of China's role in Africa and its implications for the labour market. This article examines two Chinese-built infrastructure projects in Kenya and their intersection with several issues involving migrant labour and local rumours of Chinese prisoners, as well as the state's vision for industrialization and youth employment. Kenyans utilize both online and interpersonal channels of discourse to critique present-day employment practices in the transport sector, and it is argued that these counter-channels of discourse represent a particular articulation of knowledge used by Kenyans to construct meaning and interpret ambiguous situations. Through a theoretical analysis of rumour, this article illustrates how ordinary Kenyans are pooling their intellectual resources to understand Sino-Kenyan labour relations in the absence of transparency and participatory government processes in the infrastructure sector.","[Plummer, Anita] Howard Univ, Dept African Studies, Washington, DC 20059 USA","Plummer, A (corresponding author), Howard Univ, Dept African Studies, Washington, DC 20059 USA.",anita.plummer@howard.edu,,,,,,23,2,2,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0001-9720,1750-0184,,AFRICA,Africa,NOV,2019,89,4,,,,,680,695,PII S0001972019000858,10.1017/S0001972019000858,,,16,Anthropology; Area Studies,Anthropology; Area Studies,KM5CB,WOS:000514151900004,,,,,2020-12-18,

However, SI initiatives have been criticized for neglecting social welfare outcomes. A recent review found that better-off farmers benefitted disproportionately from SI and highlighted the dearth of studies assessing the equity of outcomes. In this study, we explore the social inclusiveness of zero-tillage (ZT) wheat adoption in Bihar, India. ZT is a proven SI technology for enhancing wheat productivity while boosting profitability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural machinery in the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plains. With an average landholding size of 0.39 ha, most farmers in Bihar depend on custom-hiring services to access the technology. While service provision models should foster inclusive growth by reducing financial barriers to technology adoption, early evidence suggested that small-holders remained at a disadvantage. Building on this previous research, we use a panel dataset from 961 wheat-growing households that spans a six-year period to analyze ZT adoption dynamics over time while accounting for the role of social networks and access to service provision. Using a heckprobit approach to correct for non-exposure bias, we compare determinants of ZT awareness and use in 2012 and 2015. We apply a multinomial logit model to identify determinants of early adoption, recent adoption, nonadoption, and dis-adoption. Furthermore, we explore the quality of ZT services as an additional dimension of socially-inclusive technology access. We find that the strong initial scale bias in ZT use declined substantially as awareness of the technology increased and the service economy expanded. Land fragmentation replaced total landholding size as a significant adoption determinant, which also affected the quality of ZT services received. Hence, farmers with small but contiguous landholdings appear to have gained a significant degree of access over time. We conclude that early-stage assessments of SI may be misleading, and that private sector-based service provision can contribute to socially inclusive development outcomes as markets mature.

The current digital compensation method can reduce the CA by pre-processing the image contents but at the cost of extra memory space, processing time, and power consumption. Moreover, it is not possible to digitally compensate the CA within each color channel. Here, a practical optical approach is presented to correct the CAs, including the sub-channel ones, in the virtual reality system, whose functionality is verified by both ray-tracing analysis and experimental results. In this device, a compact ultra-broadband Pancharatnam-Berry phase lens (PBL) with complex axial molecular structure is fabricated and then hybridized with a refractive Fresnel lens. Due to their opposite chromatic dispersion, the system's CA is significantly reduced. To eliminate ghost image from the zero-order leakage of PBL, a broadband circular polarizer is implemented to block the stray light. As a result, clear image within the entire 100 degrees field-of-view is achieved. The proposed large-size cost-efficient broadband wide-view flat optics can practically benefit not only virtual reality displays but also general imaging systems for practical applications and scientific research.","[Zhan, Tao; Zou, Junyu; Xiong, Jianghao; Liu, Xiaomin; Chen, Hao; Dong, Yajie; Wu, Shin-Tson] Univ Cent Florida, Coll Opt & Photon, CREOL, Orlando, FL 32816 USA; [Liu, Xiaomin] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Phys & Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jilin; Liu, Sheng] GoerTek Elect, 5451 Great Amer Pkwy,Suite 301, Santa Clara, CA 95054 USA; [Dong, Yajie] Univ Cent Florida, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Orlando, FL 32816 USA","Wu, ST (corresponding author), Univ Cent Florida, Coll Opt & Photon, CREOL, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.",swu@creol.ucf.edu,"ZHAN, TAO/J-6886-2019","Wu, Shin-Tson/0000-0002-0943-0440",GoerTek Electronics,"The UCF group is indebted to GoerTek Electronics for financial support, and Yun-Han Lee for helpful discussion.",,28,12,12,2,24,WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH,WEINHEIM,"POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY",2195-1071,,,ADV OPT MATER,Adv.

Although social media offers organisations promoting vaccination unparalleled opportunities to promote evidence and counterbalance misinformation, we know relatively little about their internal workings. The aim of this paper is to explore the strategies, perspectives and experiences of communicators working within such organisations as they promote vaccination and respond to misinformation on social media. Methods Using qualitative methods, we purposively sampled 21 participants responsible for routine social media activity and strategy from Australian organisations actively promoting vaccination on social media, including government health departments, local health services, advocacy groups, professional associations and technical/scientific organisations. We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews to explore their perspectives and practices. Applying Risk Communication principles as a lens, we used Framework Analysis to explore the data both inductively and deductively. Results Organisations promoting vaccination face multiple challenges on social media, including misinformation, anti-science sentiment, a complex vaccination narrative and anti-vaccine activists. They developed a range of sophisticated strategies in response, including communicating with openness in an evidence-informed way; creating safe spaces to encourage audience dialogue; fostering community partnerships; and countering misinformation with care. Conclusions We recommend that communicators consider directly countering misinformation because of the potential influence on their silent audience, i.e. those observing but not openly commenting, liking or sharing posts. Refutations should be straightforward, succinct and avoid emphasizing misinformation. Communicators should consider pairing scientific evidence with stories that speak to audience beliefs and values. Finally, organisations could enhance vaccine promotion and their own credibility on social media by forming strong links with organisations sharing similar values and goals.","[Steffens, Maryke S.; Dunn, Adam G.] Macquarie Univ, Australian Inst Hlth Innovat, Ctr Hlth Informat, 75 Talavera Rd, N Ryde, NSW 2113, Australia; [Dunn, Adam G.] Boston Childrens Hosp, Computat Hlth Informat Program, Boston, MA USA; [Wiley, Kerrie E.; Leask, Julie] Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Fac Med & Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Leask, Julie] Univ Sydney, Susan Wakil Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Fac Med & Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Steffens, MS (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Australian Inst Hlth Innovat, Ctr Hlth Informat, 75 Talavera Rd, N Ryde, NSW 2113, Australia.",maryke.steffens@hdr.mq.edu.au,"Leask, Julie/ABE-2077-2020; Dunn, Adam/E-6828-2011","Leask, Julie/0000-0001-5095-1443; Dunn, Adam/0000-0002-1720-8209; Steffens, Maryke/0000-0002-4720-3986",Macquarie University Research Training Program Scholarship [2017438]; National Health & Medical Research CouncilNational Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1128968],"This work was supported by Macquarie University Research Training Program Scholarship No. 2017438 and National Health & Medical Research Council Project Grant APP1128968.

The commercialization of marijuana has been accompanied by a proliferation of false claims regarding the therapeutic potential of marijuana, which are popularized by several different information sources. To date, no study has examined where US adults get their information regarding marijuana. Objective To determine the sources of information associated with believing unsupported claims about marijuana. Design Probability-based online survey Participants 16,820 adults, with a response rate of about 55% (N = 9003) Main Measures Most influential sources of information about marijuana and belief of statements consistent with misinformation, for example, smoking marijuana has preventative health benefits, secondhand marijuana smoke or use during pregnancy is completely or somewhat safe, and marijuana is not at all addictive. Key Results There were 9003 respondents (response rate 55%). Forty-three percent believed unsupported claims about marijuana. The most influential sources of information were health professionals, traditional media, friends/relatives, and social media/internet.

Scientific debates over global catastrophic flooding and the Earth's geologic age were resolved by the mid-nineteenth century, but subsequent nonscientific debates about the Earth's age and biological evolution spawned a distrust of science that hardened in the twentieth century. Disregard for science grew in the United States with abandonment of science-based policy by government and manipulation of public opinion by social media. Consequently, climate change denial was readily accepted by a preconditioned antiscience culture. Expansion of antiscience sentiment led to rejection of conventional news outlets and information verification in a post-truth era in which alternate realities are acceptable despite clear contradictions with observable facts. Critical reasoning and vetting of information are in decline, which leaves democracy vulnerable to manipulation. Reliable information is available but obscured by disinformation. Public scrutiny of information and demand for fact checking and reporting of sources are essential given growth of alternative media that have no checks on the verity of content. Academics should get involved in popular media to counter propaganda and to reconstruct a culture of critical reasoning by voters and science-based decisions by policymakers.","[James, L.

Failure to correct these may hinder efforts to conserve energy and undermine support for evidence-based policies. Here we present a randomized online experiment that showed that home energy perceptions can be improved. We tested two simple, potentially scalable interventions: providing numerical information (in watt-hours) about extremes of energy use and providing an explicit heuristic that addressed a common misperception. Both succeeded in improving numerical estimates of energy use, but in different ways. Numerical information about extremes primarily improved the use of the watt-hours response scale, while the heuristic improved underlying understanding of relative energy use. As a result, only the heuristic significantly benefitted judgements about energy-conserving behaviours. Because understanding of energy use also predicted self-reported energy-conservation behaviour, belief in climate change, and support for climate policies, targeting energy misperceptions may have the potential to shape individual behaviour and national policy support.","[Marghetis, Tyler; Attari, Shahzeen Z.] Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Marghetis, Tyler; Landy, David] Indiana Univ, Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Landy, David] Netflix, Los Gatos, CA USA; [Marghetis, Tyler] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA","Marghetis, T (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, ONeill Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.; Marghetis, T (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Psychol & Brain Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.; Marghetis, T (corresponding author), Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA.",tyler.marghetis@gmail.com,,,"National Science Foundation from Decision, Risk and Management Sciences [SES-1658804]; Office of the Vice President of Research at Indiana University Bloomington through the Emerging Area of Research initiative, Learning: Brains, Machines and Children; Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (CASBS) at Stanford University; Carnegie Corporation of New York","This work is supported by National Science Foundation grant no.

Therefore, exploring the laws of rumor propagation has been one of the hot topics in current researches. Most traditional rumor spreading models are based on infectious disease transmission models, such as SIR. Since the influence of individual differences and the network structure on rumor spreading are not considered, the rumor propagation process in complex networks can only be described in a coarse-grained manner. In this paper, we consider the role of different users in rumor propagation. Based on the degree of different nodes in the network, we design a new state transition function for each node and proposed a new rumor propagation ILSR model. Firstly, we analyze the model, calculate the equilibrium point and the basic reproductive number to prove the rationality of the model. Then experiments are performed in WS networks, BA scale-free networks and a real Facebook network to investigate the relationship between various nodes with time and the impact of network structure on rumor propagation, and the experimental results show the correctness and effectiveness of the model. It provides a reference for exploring the propagation law of rumors in complex networks and guiding and controlling the propagation of rumors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Web moderators with a background in behavioral health are used to facilitate peer conversation to promote a sense of community, provide social support, and ensure safety. Objective: Although moderation is a core component of this intervention, little is known on best practices for moderators to ensure safety while encouraging engagement. This study sought to describe interactions between moderators and peer users and understand moderator experiences through individual interviews. Methods: Adolescents and young adults aged 14 to 26 years with depression or anxiety history were recruited for a usability study of the SOVA intervention. During this study, 14 moderators were trained to regularly review comments to blog posts for safety, facilitate conversation, and correct misinformation. A total of 110 blog posts and their associated comments were extracted and coded using a codebook based on items from the supportive accountability model and a peer social support analysis. Closing interviews with 12 moderators assessing their experience of moderating were conducted, recorded, and transcribed. Blog post text and comments as well as transcripts of moderator interviews were assessed using a thematic analysis approach, and blog posts were examined for trends in content of moderator comments comparing blog posts with differences in comment contributor order. Results: There were no safety concerns during the study, and moderators only intervened to remove identifiable information. Web moderators exhibited elements of supportive accountability (such as being perceived as experts and using verbal rewards as well as offering informational and emotional support). When the moderators provided the last comment under a blog post, thereby potentially ending contribution by users, they were at times found to be commenting about their own experiences. Moderators interviewed after completing their role expressed challenges in engaging users. A cohort of moderators who received more extensive training on supportive accountability and peer social support felt their ability to engage users improved because of the training. Conclusions: Moderators of a Web-based support site for adolescents with depression or anxiety were able to ensure safety while promoting user engagement. Moderators can elicit user engagement by offering gratitude and encouragement to users, asking users follow-up questions, and limiting their own opinions and experiences when responding to comments.","[Windler, Carolyn] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, 3550 Terrace St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Clair, Maeve; Long, Cassandra] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA; [Clair, Maeve] UPMC Childrens Hosp, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Boyle, Leah] Chatham Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15232 USA; [Radovic, Ana] Univ Pittsburgh, UPMC Childrens Hosp Pittsburgh, Div Adolescent & Young Adult Med, Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA","Windler, C (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, 3550 Terrace St, Pittsburgh, PA 15261 USA.",cmw185@pitt.edu,,"Clair, Maeve/0000-0002-0128-256X; Windler, Carolyn/0000-0003-0817-8404; Radovic MD, MSc, Ana/0000-0002-4022-4151",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [NIMH 1K23MH111922-01A1]; UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (Student Research Training Program); University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (Dean's Summer Research Program); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [K23MH111922] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH 1K23MH111922-01A1); UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (Student Research Training Program); and the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (Dean's Summer Research Program).,,43,2,3,2,12,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",2368-7959,,,JMIR MENT HEALTH,JMIR Ment.

To extend the dynamic range considerably, the already successfully demonstrated concept of a linear self-reset pixel was employed in this work. With the self-reset concept the limit of the maximum analyzable photo generated charge (Q(max)) during the exposure time is extended to a multiple of the saturation charge of the photo diode (Q(sat)) by asynchronous self-resets of the photo diode. Additionally, the remaining charge at the end of the exposure time is evaluated to increase the resolution of the optoelectronic conversion. Thus we achieved pixels with a DR of more than 120 dB combined with an improved low light sensitivity using a pinned photodiode. This paper focuses on two topics: One is the realization and opto-electronic characterization of further self-reset pixel cells for an experimental optimization of the functionality with respect to linearity and high signal-to-noise ratio. The second one is the assembly and digital readout of a cluster structure composed of 16 x 16 pixel matrix on a CMOS test chip. One constraint for later usage of the pixel cells in a high resolution (> VGA) image sensor is the required layout area of the individual circuit blocks. For the cluster structure a size of 20 x 20 mu m(2) for the analog part of the pixel containing the photo diode and the other analog circuit blocks, the comparator and the signal shaping, was desired. The circuit design and layout work included several variants of the pinned photo diode with floating diffusion (FD) readout node, which is also used for analog voltage storage, and different control transistors. Further for the comparator a telescopic differential amplifier with high gain was implemented as well as peripheral 10 bit counter/shift register as static and dynamic versions. Test chips have been fabricated in an advanced 0.18 mu m CMOS technology for optical sensors with low leakage currents. The sensor chips have been evaluated with a specifically developed test setup which gives the flexibility to arbitrarily generate the digital and analog control signals in terms of timing and voltage levels. Based on this, the number of asynchronous self-resets could be read out from the counters of the pixel cells as coarse values. The remaining charge at the end of the integration time was digitized using a ramp analog to digital conversion and could be read out as fine values. An opto-electronic characterization with adjustable illumination from 0 lx to 13 klx was done to measure and analyze the opto-electronic conversion function (OECF) and the noise of six different self-reset pixel cells having the high-gain differential amplifier as comparator. Finally the coarse values of two implemented 16 x 16 pixel clusters could be read out as a mini camera using a lens for optical image formation.","[Hirsch, Stefan; Strobel, Markus; Klingler, Wolfram; Spuentrup, Jan Dirk Schulze; Yu, Zili; Burghartz, Joachim N.] Inst Mikroelekt Stuttgart IMS CHIPS, Allmandring 30a, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany","Hirsch, S (corresponding author), Inst Mikroelekt Stuttgart IMS CHIPS, Allmandring 30a, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany.",hirsch@ims-chips.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the project MULTI-3DFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [13N14227]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the project SITARAFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [13N12996],This work has been supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the projects MULTI-3D (grant no. 13N14227) in the funding program Photonic Research Germany and SITARA (grant no. 13N12996).,,17,0,0,0,3,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1684-9965,1684-9973,,ADV RADIO SCI,Adv.

By using a single-stage cascode amplifier for each PUF cell, the output impedance can be significantly elevated. Compared with a traditional single-stage amplifier-based current-mode PUF, the proposed structure is capable of generating more polarized voltage value for the output node. With an additional digital buffer, the temporal noise can be well-suppressed, and a rail-to-rail digital output can be provided with high native reliability. Moreover, through operating the transistors at the subthreshold region, the overall power consumption can be dramatically reduced. Featuring a compact footprint of 3.23 mu m(2) (i.e. 764 F-2) for each PUF cell, the proposed PUF implementation is validated using 65-nm standard CMOS process. The excellent randomness of the proposed PUF design is verified based on the test results with widely-accepted auto-correlation function and NIST suites. Meanwhile, the PUF's uniqueness is measured with 10 chip prototypes and reported to be 49.94%. In addition, the fabricated PUF chips were also characterized with various environmental influences. With multiple readout (500 times) under the reference operating temperature of 27 degrees C and supply voltage of 1.2 V, the native unstable bit ratio is measured to be as low as 1.50%, which can be further improved to 0.79% by adopting the mainstream temporal majority voting (TMV)-based error correction scheme. Besides, we also evaluate the fabricated PUF chips' reliability under varied operating temperature from -40 degrees C to 120 degrees C and supply voltage from 0.95 to 1.3 V. The averaged bit error rate (BER) per 10 degrees C and BER per 0.1 V are measured to be 0.86% and 1.02%, respectively.

To present a digital method that combines intraoral and face scanning for the computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) fabrication of implant-supported bars for maxillary overdentures. Methods. Over a 2-year period, all patients presenting to a private dental clinic with a removable complete denture in the maxilla, seeking rehabilitation with implants, were considered for inclusion in this study. Inclusion criteria were fully edentulous maxilla, functional problems with the preexisting denture, opposing dentition, and sufficient bone volume to insert four implants. Exclusion criteria were age < 55 years, need for bone augmentation, uncompensated diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised status, radio- and/or chemotherapy, and previous treatment with oral and/or intravenous aminobisphosphonates. All patients were rehabilitated with a maxillary overdenture supported by a CAD/CAM polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) implant-supported bar. The outcomes of the study were the passive fit/adaptation of the bar, the 1-year implant survival, and the success rates of the implant-supported overdentures. Results. 15 patients (6 males, 9 females; mean age 68 8 +/- 4 7 years) received 60 implants and were rehabilitated with a maxillary overdenture supported by a PEEK bar, designed and milled from an intraoral digital impression. The intraoral scans were integrated with face scans, in order to design each bar with all available patient data (soft tissues, prosthesis, implants, and face) in the correct spatial position. When testing the 3D-printed resin bar, 12 bars out of 15 (80%) had a perfect passive adaptation and fit; in contrast, 3 out of 15 (20%) did not have a sufficient passive fit or adaptation. No implants were lost, for a 1-year survival of 100% (60/60 surviving implants). However, some complications (two fixtures with peri-implantitis in the same patient and two repaired overdentures in two different patients) occurred. This determined a 1-year success rate of 80% for the implant-supported overdenture. Conclusions. In this study, the combination of intraoral and face scans allowed to successfully restore fully edentulous patients with maxillary overdentures supported by 4 implants and a CAD/CAM PEEK bar. Further studies are needed to confirm these outcomes.","[Mangano, Francesco; Margiani, Bidzina; Admakin, Oleg] Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Dept Prevent & Communal Dent, Moscow 119992, Russia; [Mangano, Carlo] Vita & Salute Univ San Raffaele, Dept Dent Sci, I-20132 Milan, Italy","Mangano, F (corresponding author), Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Dept Prevent & Communal Dent, Moscow 119992, Russia.",francescomangano1@mclink.net,"Mangano, Francesco/AAG-6184-2019","Mangano, Francesco/0000-0001-5488-4268",,,,41,11,11,0,11,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",0161-0457,1932-8745,,SCANNING,Scanning,AUG 22,2019,2019,,,,,,,,4274715,10.1155/2019/4274715,,,14,Instruments & Instrumentation; Microscopy,Instruments & Instrumentation; Microscopy,IW1IP,WOS:000484721000001,31531155,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-18,

Natural polymers, such as collagen and fibrin hydrogels, have experienced especially broad adoption due to the high density of cell adhesion sites compared to their synthetic counterparts, ready availability, and ease of use. However, these and other hydrogels lack the structural and mechanical anisotropy that define the ECM in many tissues, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, tendon, and cartilage. Herein, we present a facile, low-cost, and automated method of preparing collagen microfibers, organizing these fibers into precisely controlled mesh designs, and embedding these meshes in a bulk hydrogel, creating a composite biomaterial suitable for a wide variety of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. With the assistance of custom software tools described herein, mesh patterns are designed by a digital graphical user interface and translated into protocols that are executed by a custom mesh collection and organization device. We demonstrate a high degree of precision and reproducibility in both fiber and mesh fabrication, evaluate single fiber mechanical properties, and provide evidence of collagen self-assembly in the microfibers under standard cell culture conditions. This work offers a powerful, flexible platform for the study of tissue engineering and cell material interactions, as well as the development of therapeutic biomaterials in the form of custom collagen microfiber patterns that will be accessible to all through the methods and techniques described here. Impact Statement Collagen microfiber meshes have immediate and broad applications in tissue engineering research and show high potential for later use in clinical therapeutics due to their compositional similarities to native extracellular matrix and tunable structural and mechanical characteristics. Physical and biological characterizations of these meshes demonstrate physiologically relevant mechanical properties, native-like collagen structure, and cytocompatibility. The methods presented herein not only describe a process through which custom collagen microfiber meshes can be fabricated but also provide the reader with detailed device plans and software tools to produce their own bespoke meshes through a precise, consistent, and automated process.","[Kaiser, Nicholas J.; Bellows, Jessica A.; Kant, Rajeev J.; Coulombe, Kareen L.

The public popularity of social media and social networks has caused a contagion of fake news where conspiracy theories, disinformation and extreme views flourish. Detection and mitigation of fake news is one of the fundamental problems of our times and has attracted widespread attention. While fact checking websites such as snopes, politifact and major companies such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter have taken preliminary steps towards addressing fake news, much more remains to be done. As an interdisciplinary topic, various facets of fake news have been studied by communities as diverse as machine learning, databases, journalism, political science and many more. The objective of this tutorial is two-fold. First, we wish to familiarize the database community with the efforts by other communities on combating fake news. We provide a panoramic view of the state-of-the-art of research on various aspects including detection, propagation, mitigation, and intervention of fake news. Next, we provide a concise and intuitive summary of prior research by the database community and discuss how it could be used to counteract fake news. The tutorial covers research from areas such as data integration, truth discovery and fusion, probabilistic databases, knowledge graphs and crowdsourcing from the lens of fake news. Effective tools for addressing fake news could only be built by leveraging the synergistic relationship between database and other research communities. We hope that our tutorial provides an impetus towards such synthesis of ideas and the creation of new ones.","[Lakshmanan, Laks V.

The purpose of this study was to assess experimentally the potential effectiveness of the agreement in addressing NAS misperceptions. Methods In an online experiment, 820 current and former smokers were assigned randomly to advertising conditions with existing claims from NAS advertisements, modified claims or a no-exposure control. Advertising conditions included (1) 'original' NAS advertising text before the agreement; (2) '2017 agreement' language permissible under the FDA-SFNTC agreement (removing 'natural', 'additive-free'); (3) more restrictive ('stricter') language representing additional regulation (removing 'natural' from the brand name and the phrases 'tobacco+water', 'no chemicals'). Participants completed outcome measures assessing misinformed beliefs and intentions towards NAS. Results One-way ANOVA showed that relative to the 'original' language, the '2017 agreement' language reduced misconceptions about NAS addictiveness, but not about health or constituent composition. Yet 'stricter' language significantly reduced all categories of misinformed beliefs, which in turn mediated effects on (lower) intentions to use NAS. Conclusion The 2017 agreement helps dispel some misconceptions about NAS addictiveness, but does not sufficiently rectify misinformation about health or composition. Since 'stricter' language more effectively corrects misinformed beliefs, our results suggest the need for further regulations in addressing misinformation that drives intentions towards NAS.","[Gratale, Stefanie K.; Maloney, Erin K.; Cappella, Joseph N.] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA","Gratale, SK (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",stefanie.gratale@asc.upenn.edu,,,"National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI); Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)United States Department of Health & Human Services [P50CA179546]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546, P50CA179546] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","Data collection was supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under Award Number P50CA179546.",,32,3,3,0,2,BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",0964-4563,1468-3318,,TOB CONTROL,Tob.

In the present work in vitro data on the removal of these substances and CO2 are presented. Methods: An ex vivo model using porcine blood was established and applied in detoxification tests for water soluble and protein bound retention solutes. 3 x 3.3L of blood with high bilirubin (30 mg/dl) and lactate levels (>10 mmol/l) were treated with ADVOS multi for 4 hours each. This design, with 3 phases changing blood every 4 hours, led to high concentrations of both markers in blood during the 12 h test period. For CO2 removal tests, 5 liters of blood were used instead. In both cases, a continuous CO2 supply through an additional dialyzer was applied. Results: Bilirubin and lactate were efficiently removed during 12hrs of in vitro detoxification. Lactate removal rates were 90%, 86% and 84% for phase 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Bilirubin elimination rates were 66%, 62%, and 57%, resulting in a total elimination of 1150 mg in 12 hrs. Albumin binding capacity was determined to be >76% at the end of the treatment indicating that albumin was not denatured in the dialysate of the ADVOS system. CO2 removal with ADVOS multi depends on three variables: 1) The amount of supplied CO2 depends on concentrate flow affecting both, blood pCO2 and bicarbonate levels; 2) blood flow, and 3) dialysate pH and composition (i.e., carbonate concentration). A maximum CO2 removal of 142 ml/min was achieved with a carbonate-free dialysate at pH 10, a blood flow of 400 ml/min and a concentrate flow of 160 ml/min. Given that blood gases are maintained within physiological conditions, a CO2 removal rate of 61 ml/min can be achieved. During all the experiments blood pH was set to 7.35-7.45. Discussion:ADVOS multi is a device using albumin recirculation in its secondary circuit. Here, albumin binding capacity remains stable through a systematic modification of its tertiary structure through temperature and pH changes in the ADVOS multi circuit. This facilitates the release of toxins from albumin and allows for further binding. Moreover, presence of albumin, variable dialysate composition and the flexible dialysate pH might facilitate the treatment of patients with multiple organ failure. Objectives:Given the extent of bypass graft failure, the motivation behind this multidisciplinary project is to improve the patency of the current bypass grafts by developing a novel and optimised blood flow augmentation technique. Methods: One of the most significant contributions to the improvement of haemodynamics in grafts was based on a research which showed that the 'spiral flow' is a natural phenomenon in the whole arterial system and is induced by the twisting of the left ventricle during contraction and then accentuated upon entering the aortic arch. The benefit of this flow pattern lies in removing unfavourable haemodynamic environment such as turbulence, stagnation and oscillatory shear stress, which are believed to be the main causes of intimal hyperplasia at anastomotic configurations. Results:This multi-disciplinary engineering venture has resulted in a unique product which makes use of both non-planar helicity and an optimised internal ridge within the graft to achieve a significantly improved haemodynamic condition within the anastomosis (an anastomosis is a surgical connection between autologous/prosthetic grafts and veins/arteries inside the human body) Discussion:This truly multidisciplinary project has integrated fluid mechanics, biomechanics and biology with cardiovascular surgery to develop a novel biomedical device, inspired by the nuclear engineering sector. The novel spiral-inducing bypass graft, nominated for this award, is the best example of how engineering techniques, tools and designs can lead to life-saving innovations that could potentially save the lives of thousands of people and save millions of pounds for the healthcare systems across the world. Such successful engineering stories are what would encourage the next generation of engineers to go beyond the traditional boundaries of engineering disciplines to make a difference. Objectives:The goal of this work was to study methods that will allow increase in spatial freedom of couplers orientation in inductive powering unit for implantable medical devices. An inductive energy transfer system is considered, therefore the freedom of relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving coils must be optimized. Methods:The design procedure of inductive powering unit (IPU) consists of two main steps: design of the power amplifier and optimization of an inductive link. To account for the patient specifics, such as tissue thickness near the implantation site, a number of different couplers were simulated using finite element modeling. Effect of coils geometrical parameters on mutual inductance and inductive link efficiency was examined. Class E power amplifier was chosen as a driver for the transmitting coil. Capacitors in the amplifier loading network were tuned to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS). A patient's everyday activity, including walking and even breathing, leads to misalignment of the transmitting and receiving coils, and, as a result, detuning of the amplifier from ZVS and increased losses. Feedback schemes were studied to compensate the misalignments effect on the amplifier. Results:A self-oscillating IPU with class E amplifier was designed that provides stable output power about 0.5 W for the distance between the couplers in range 10-20 mm and the lateral distance up to 20 mm. The use of self-oscillating circuit in the transmitter increases spatial freedom of the transmitting and receiving coils corresponding to ZVS. Discussion: Inductive link geometrical parameters optimization and implementation of self-oscillating class E driver the IPU contributes to stable output power and efficiency of IPU. As a result, less intervention from the patient and physician is required, and patient quality of life is increased Precision medicine emerges from integration of a number of emerging technologies and the data they produce with modern data analytics. For precision diagnostics and for predicting drug responses new computational and in-vitro models are needed from gene regulation to cellular and organ functions. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC) derived e.g., from patient blood cells provide means to produce most cell types and thus provide means to get patient specific in-vitro models. New technologies are needed to produce tissues from these cells and to assess the cell functions in-vitro. In addition, computational in-silico models can be used to augment our understanding of the diseases or drug effects. They also provide tools to translate the in-vitro findings to clinical settings and patient populations. We are in transition to turn our in-vitro cell culture models to body-on-chip platforms including environmental control and biophysical functional sensing. We have developed methods to assess the cellular functions based on electrophysiological sensing as well as 2D and 3D bioimaging. For example, we have developed imaging methods to assess functions of hIPSC cardiac cell with simultaneous assessment of electrophysiology such as Calcium and voltage transients as well as mechanobiology in vitro. Further, we have developed in-silico models of various cellular function including multi-cell-type neuronal networks and in-silico population models of the hIPSC cardiomyocytes. The later ones are providing us ionic machinery of hIPSC derived cardiomyocyte electrophysiology in various populations of patiets. We have shown that these computational models can represent pathological patient phenotype cells and populations of patients with specific mutations, e.g., long QT syndrome. We have also demonstrated the power of in-silico as possible pre-screening method for drug effects prior to in-vitro examinations. Moreover, our in-silico results highlight the need of careful consideration of use of HiPSC models before they can be turned from immature cell models to mature tissues in vitro. With integration of novel engineering expertise from multimodal sensing, imaging and computational modelling, we have shown their power on studying diseases and for pre-screening of compounds. Our results demonstrate the power of combined in-vitro and in-silco methods for future precision medicine. Objectives: We have developed in vivo tissue engineered autologous vascular grafts constructed in the subcutaneous of the recipient body. However, since the formation of the vascular grafts depends on the conditions of recipients including high risk or immature patients, immaturity in the fabricated tissues might be problematic for the severely diseased patients because of their suppressed regenerative activity. Therefore, possibility of the xenogeneic or the allogeneic implantation of the grafts should be evaluated. The objective of this study is to fabricate cardiovascular grafts using xenogeneic or allogeneic animals. Methods: Silicone rod molds were placed into subcutaneous pouches of beagle dogs, and after 4 weeks the implants with their surrounded connective tissues were harvested. Those were decellularized with detergents and stored at -20 degrees C for 1 week. Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 2 mm) were xeno-transplanted to abdominal aorta of the rats. Decellularized tubular connective tissues (internal diameter: 5 mm) were cut open and trimmed to elliptical sheets of 15 x 8 mm, they were allo-transplanted to carotid arteries of other beagle dogs as vascular patches. Results: Both xenogeneic vascular grafts and allogeneic patch grafts performed well after transplantation, and the luminal surfaces after resection were very smooth. Histological evaluation also showed host cells infiltration into the grafts. Discussion: Decellularized xenogeneic and allogeneic connective tissue membranes could be ideal vascular grafts.

This focus is correlated with in vitro 3D tumor models ability to mimic the multicellular compact structure and spatial architecture of human solid tumors. However, these microphysiological systems generally lack the preexistence of tumor-ECM, a critical aspect that can affect the overall therapeutic performance and the decision of advancing candidate drugs to later stages of the pipeline. Aiming to face this drawback and mimic tumors-ECM, herein we rapidly fabricated in-air hyaluronan-methacrylate (HA-MA) and gelatin-methacrylate (GeIMA) photocrosslinkable 3D spheroid microgels by using superhydrophobic surfaces. These platforms were used for establishing heterotypic 3D co-culture models of prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and human osteoblasts (hOB) to mimic prostate cancer-to-bone metastasis cellular heterogeneity and the tumor-ECM microenvironment. 3D microgel microtumors morphology, size and cell number were easily controlled via digital droplet generation on polystyrene superhydrophobic surfaces and under solvent-free conditions when compared to microfluidics or electrospray. Co-culture 3D micro gels formed by 2.5%HA-MA-5%GeIMA and 5%HA-MA-5%GeIMA ratios showed the highest calcium deposition after 14 days of culture, evidencing osteoblasts viability and the establishment of functional mineralization in the 3D hydrogel matrix. Cisplatin cytotoxicity evaluation showed that 3D microgels are more resistant to platin chemotherapeutics than single or co-culture 3D multicellular spheroid counterparts. Overall, our findings indicate that solvent-free, in-air produced 3D microgel microenvironments are cost-effective and robust tumor mimicking platforms for in vitro high-throughput screening of therapeutics targeted to prostate-to-bone metastasis microenvironments. Statement of Significance The generation of robust microphysiological systems that recapitulate the complexity of the metastatic prostate-to-bone tumor microenvironment is crucial for pre-clinical evaluation of new therapeutics that can eradicate these secondary tumors. In this study, we employed superhydrophobic (SH) surfaces to rapidly fabricate photocrosslinkable hyaluronan-methacrylate/gelatin-methacrylate 3D spheroid microgels for prostate cancer cells and human osteoblasts co-culture models that simultaneously mimic the cellular and ECM tumor components. The use of SH platforms overcomes the issues of standard in-liquid microgel production technologies by providing a robust control over 3D microgels size/morphology and cell-cell co-encapsulation numbers, while avoiding the use of oil-based microgel droplets generation.

J,"Beck, V",,,,"Beck, Valentin",,,Consumer Boycotts as Instruments for Structural Change,JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHILOSOPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Consumer boycotts have become a frequent form of social protest in the digital age. The corporate malpractices motivating them are varied, including environmental pollution, lack of minimum labour standards, severe mistreatment of animals, lobbying and misinformation campaigns, collaboration or complicity with illegitimate political regimes, and systematic tax evasion and tax fraud. In this article, I argue that organised consumer boycotts should be regarded as a legitimate and purposeful instrument for structural change, provided they conform to a number of normative criteria. In order to show this, the practice and empirical context of consumer boycotts are first outlined. I then lay out and refute three general objections to this practice. Although each of these objections fails, their discussion generates insights concerning the normative standards with which boycotters must comply if they want their campaigns to be both legitimate and successful. These normative criteria are detailed along the lines of two guiding principles, proportionality and transparency. In the final step, I elaborate on structural change as the deeper purpose of consumer boycotts.","[Beck, Valentin] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Philosophy, Thielallee 43, D-14195 Berlin, Germany","Beck, V (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Inst Philosophy, Thielallee 43, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",valentin.beck@fu-berlin.de,,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0264-3758,1468-5930,,J APPL PHILOS,J.

The imager is fabricated in a standard front side illuminated 0.18 mu m CMOS image sensor process. Each pixel comprises a 25 mu m diameter SPAD, a variable-load passive quenching circuit implemented with 1.8 V PMOS, an 8-bit counter, an 8-bit latch register, and digital processing electronics, and feeds an 8-bit output bus. The array delivers two-dimensional intensity data through photon counting, with integration time as low as 5 mu s over the full dynamic range. Per-pixel digital memory enables fully parallel processing and global-shutter mode readout. The imager can acquire fast optical events at high frame rate (up to 200 kfps) and at single-photon sensitivity. The imager has an 8-pixel (64-bit) parallel output bus. This imager enables for the first time the detection and arrival-direction determination of individual muzzle flashes in real time, and even in the case of bursts of flashes, at a moderate cost and size.

The NLP framework includes sentiment analysis, entity analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based phrase association mining. The sentiment analysis demonstrates the sentiment fluctuation over the past 10 years. The results show that there are more negative tweets in 2008 to 2011 and 2015 to 2016. The entity extraction and analysis help to identify the organization, geographical location and events entities associated with the negative and positive tweets. The results show that the organization entities such as FDA, CDC and Merck occur in both negative and positive tweets of almost every year, whereas the geographical location entities mentioned in both negative and positive tweets change from year to year. The reason is because of the specific events that happened in those different locations. The objective of the AI-based phrase association mining is to identify the main topics reflected in both negative and positive tweets and detailed tweet content. Through the phrase association mining, we found that the main negative topics on Twitter include injuries, deaths, scandal, safety concerns, and adverse/side effects, whereas the main positive topics include cervical cancers, cervical screens, prevents, and vaccination campaigns. We believe the results of this research can help public health researchers better understand the nature of social media influence on HPV vaccination attitudes and to develop strategies to counter the proliferation of misinformation.","[Luo, Xiao; Shah, Setu] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Purdue Sch Engn & Technol, 799 W Michigan St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Zimet, Gregory] Indiana Univ Sch Med, Pediat Adolescent Hlth, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA","Luo, X (corresponding author), Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Purdue Sch Engn & Technol, 799 W Michigan St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.",luo25@iupui.edu,,"Zimet, Gregory/0000-0003-3835-937X; Shah, Setu/0000-0003-2951-2272",,,,22,3,3,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2164-5515,2164-554X,,HUM VACC IMMUNOTHER,Human Vaccines Immunother.,AUG 3,2019,15,7-8,,,SI,,1496,1504,,10.1080/21645515.2019.1627821,,JUL 2019,9,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Immunology,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Immunology,IS6OP,WOS:000476426900001,31194609,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2020-12-18,

With these new technologies comes an essential need for testing methods to assess the resultant image quality. Although randomized clinical trials are the gold standard for assessing image quality, phantom-based studies can provide a simpler and less burdensome approach. In this work, a complete framework is presented for task-based evaluation of microcalcification (MCs) detection performance for DBT imaging systems. Methods The framework consists of three parts. The first part is a realistic anthropomorphic physical breast phantom created through inkjet printing, with parchment paper and iodine-doped ink. The second is a method for inserting realistic MCs fabricated from calcium hydroxyapatite. The reproducibility and stability of the phantom materials were investigated through multiple samples of parchment and ink over 6 months. The final part is an analysis using a four-alternative forced choice (4AFC) reader study. To demonstrate the framework, a task-based 4AFC study was conducted using a clinical system to compare performance from DBT, synthetic mammography (SM), and full-field digital mammography (FFDM). Nine human observers read images containing MC clusters imaged with all three modalities and tried to correctly locate the MCs. The proportion correct (PC) was measured as the number of correctly detected clusters out of all trials. Results Overall, readers scored the highest with FFDM, (PC = 0.95 +/- 0.03) then DBT (0.85 +/- 0.04), and finally SM (0.44 +/- 0.06). For the parchment and ink samples, the linear attenuation properties were very stable over 6 months. In addition, little difference was found between the various parchment and ink samples, indicating good reproducibility. Conclusions This framework presents a promising methodology for evaluating diagnostic task performance of clinical breast DBT systems.","[Ikejimba, Lynda C.; Salad, Jesse; Graff, Christian G.; Ghammraoui, Bahaa; Cheng, Wei-Chung; Glick, Stephen J.] US FDA, 10903 New Hampshire Ave, Silver Spring, MD 20993 USA; [Lo, Joseph Y.] Duke Univ, Med Phys Grad Program, 2424 Erwin Rd, Durham, NC 27705 USA","Ikejimba, LC (corresponding author), US FDA, 10903 New Hampshire Ave, Silver Spring, MD 20993 USA.",Lynda.Ikejimba@fda.hhs.gov,,,Critical Path grant from the Center for Devices and Radiological Health,"The authors acknowledge the help of Dr. Guo Zhang with the Foursquare software, and the help of Dr. Frank Samuelson and Dr. Brandon Gallas with the statistical analysis.

We present results from two experiments, conducted online and over the telephone, in which respondents were presented with Trump misstatements on climate change. While Trump's misstatements on their own reduced factual accuracy, corrections prompted the average subject to become more accurate. Republicans were not as affected by a correction as their Democratic counterparts, but their factual beliefs about climate change were never more affected by Trump than by the facts. In neither experiment did corrections affect policy preferences. Debunking treatments can improve factual accuracy even among co-partisans subjected to presidential misinformation. Yet an increase in climate-related factual accuracy does not sway climate-related attitudes.

On the internet, a huge amount of information competes for our (limited) attention. Moreover, despite the increasing quantity of contents, quality may be poor, making the environment particularly florid for misinformation spreading. In such a context, our cognitive biases emerge, first and foremost, confirmation bias, i.e. the human tendency to look for information that is already in agreement with one's system of beliefs. To shade light on the phenomenon, we present a collection of works investigating how information gets consumed and shapes communities on Facebook. We find that confirmation bias plays a crucial role in content selection and diffusion, and we provide empirical evidence of the existence of echo chambers, i.e. well separated and polarised groups of like-minded users sharing a same narrative. Immersed in these bubbles, users keep framing and reinforcing their world view, ignoring information dissenting from their preferred narrative. In this scenario, corrections in the form of fact-checking or debunking attempts seem to fail and have instead a backfire effect. To contrast misinformation, smoothing polarisation is so essential, and may require the design of tailored counter-narratives and appropriate communication strategies, particularly for sensitive topics.

Rumor as unverified information also considerably spreads in social networks. The study of how rumor spreads and how it can be controlled, plays an important role in reducing social and psychological damages of rumor in social networks. Although recent researches have mainly focused on epidemic models and structure of social networks, they ignore the impact of people's decision on rumor process. In this paper, an evolutionary game model is proposed to analyze the rumor process in social network considering the impacts of people's decisions on rumor propagation and control. The model considers a rumor control mechanism via sending anti-rumor messages through rumor control centers. Factors affecting the people's decisions including social anxiety, people's attitude toward rumor/anti-rumor, strength of rumor/anti-rumor, influence of rumor control centers, and participation of people in discussions are studied in the model. The proposed game model is analyzed by replicator dynamics equations and simulation of the imitation update rule on a synthetic (Barabasi-Albert) and two real-world graphs of Twitter and Facebook. We further analyze the model in various environments considering people characteristics and society situation. Also we use a real rumor dataset of Twitter (Pheme dataset) to first compare the trends of people strategies (rumor/anti-rumor spreader and ignorant) derived by the model with the real trends of the traits of people in the rumor spreading on Twitter. Then we conduct a number of sensitivity analysis experiments to show the impact of different factors on rumor process. In fact, we analyze the trends of people strategies in Pheme dataset assuming various possible conditions. The analysis show that propagation of convincing anti-rumor messages and locating rumor control centers impact debunking the rumor. Moreover, it is shown that people attitude toward rumor/anti-rumor has significant impact on rumor spreading. Besides, factors such as social anxiety and strength of rumor accelerates rumor propagation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Although effective in the lab, they are relatively untested in online experiments, and the quality of responses is largely unexplored. Closed-ended questions are easier to use online because they generally require only single key- or mouse-press responses and are less cognitively demanding, but they can bias the responses. We compared the data quality obtained using open and closed response formats using the continued-influence effect (CIE), in which participants read a series of statements about an unfolding event, one of which is unambiguously corrected later. Participants typically continue to refer to the corrected misinformation when making inferential statements about the event. We implemented this basic procedure online (Exp. 1A, n = 78), comparing standard open-ended responses to an alternative procedure using closed-ended responses (Exp. 1B, n = 75). Finally, we replicated these findings in a larger preregistered study (Exps. 2A and 2B, n = 323). We observed the CIE in all conditions: Participants continued to refer to the misinformation following a correction, and their references to the target misinformation were broadly similar in number across open- and closed-ended questions. We found that participants' open-ended responses were relatively detailed (including an average of 75 characters for inference questions), and almost all responses attempted to address the question. The responses were faster, however, for closed-ended questions. Overall, we suggest that with caution it may be possible to use either method for gathering CIE data.","[Desai, Saoirse Connor; Reimers, Stian] City Univ London, Dept Psychol, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England","Desai, SC (corresponding author), City Univ London, Dept Psychol, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",saoirse.connor-desai@city.ac.uk,"Desai, Saoirse Connor/ABB-5263-2020","Desai, Saoirse Connor/0000-0001-7225-8973; Reimers, Stian/0000-0002-9497-0942",,,,46,4,4,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1554-351X,1554-3528,,BEHAV RES METHODS,Behav.

Research on miscarriages of justice and misleading evidence, as well as various inquires in the UK and the US, have highlighted human error as an issue within forensic science. This has led to increased attention to the sources of cognitive bias and potential countermeasures within many forensic disciplines. However, the area of digital forensics has yet to pay sufficient attention to this issue. The main goal of this article is to contribute to a more scientifically sound digital forensics domain by addressing the issues of cognitive bias as a source of error. In this paper we present an analysis of seven sources of cognitive and human error specifically within the digital forensics process, and discuss relevant countermeasures. We conclude that although some cognitive and bias issues are very similar across forensic domains, others are different and dependent on the specific characteristic of the domain in question, such as digital forensics. There is a need for new directions in research with regard to cognitive and human factors in digital forensics. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the second study, with 1245 participants, we compared the motivational impact of two quantifiers (a large number' and nearly half' which were associated with the highest perceived uptake (48.9%) and considered least misleading in study 1 respectively) with a control message that did not contain any information on uptake, and a message which communicated actual uptake as a proportion (43%).ResultsWhile we found that both verbal quantifiers increased screening intentions compared with the control group (from 7.8 to 12.5%, aOR 1.72; 95%CI 1.00-2.96 in the case of a large number' and 14.3%, aOR 2.02; 95%CI 1.20-3.38 for nearly half'), simply communicating that 43% do the test, however, had no impact on intentions (9.9% vs. 7.8% aOR 1.25; 95%CI 0.73-2.16).ConclusionVerbal quantifiers can be used to improve the perception of low uptake figures and avoid a demotivating effect.","[Stoffel, Sandro T.; Goodwin, Maria; von Wagner, Christian] UCL, Res Dept Behav Sci & Hlth, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Sieverding, Monika] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Psychol, D-69117 Heidelberg, Germany; [Vlaev, Ivo] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England","von Wagner, C (corresponding author), UCL, Res Dept Behav Sci & Hlth, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",s.stoffel@ucl.ac.uk; c.wagner@ucl.ac.uk,,"Von Wagner, Christian/0000-0002-7971-0691; Stoffel, Sandro Tiziano/0000-0002-0124-0941",Cancer Research UKCancer Research UK [C1418/A14134],"Financial support for this study was provided entirely by a Cancer Research UK (C1418/A14134).

Methods A YouTube search was performed on https://www.youtube.com/for videos pertaining to retinopathy of prematurity and ROP. The first 100 relevant videos were included in the study. Two ophthalmologist reviewers independently evaluated and classified the videos as useful or misleading. The videos were accepted as useful, if they provide scientifically correct information about any aspect of ROP: cause, pathogenesis, symptoms, findings, treatments, procedure details of the treatment, epidemiology, and prognosis. The videos contain scientifically unproven information are defined as misleading. Videos were also classified according to the source: surgeon/practitioner, independent user, hospital/free clinic, social media/TV, medical site, university, and advertisement. Results The mean duration, the mean days on YouTube, the mean comments per videos, and the mean dislikes per video were similar in useful and misleading videos. However, the mean likes per day, mean view per video, and mean view per day were significantly higher in useful videos than those of misleading videos (p = 0.004, p = 0.022, and p = 0.011, respectively). Most of the useful videos were uploaded by healthcare professionals including source from university, hospital/free clinic, and surgeon/practitioner (48/64). The videos uploaded by healthcare professionals were more useful compared to those of non-healthcare professionals (p = 0.029). Conclusion YouTube could be used as an important tool for patient information in ROP. However, one third of the YouTube videos regarding ROP are misleading and may present a risk of harmful consequences. In this aspect, authoritative videos by healthcare professionals should be uploaded for dissemination of reliable information on ROP.","[Sahin, Alparslan] Private Batman Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Batman, Turkey; [Sahin, Muhammed] Dicle Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Sch Med, Diyarbakir, Turkey; [Turkcu, Fatih Mehmet] Private Zilan Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Batman, Turkey","Sahin, A (corresponding author), Private Batman Hosp, Dept Ophthalmol, Batman, Turkey.",dralparslansahin@gmail.com,,"sahin, muhammed/0000-0002-5229-7630; Sahin, Alparslan/0000-0003-2901-9699",,,,11,8,8,0,1,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0021-1265,1863-4362,,IRISH J MED SCI,Irish J.

However, few studies have empirically examined whether temporal self-boosting rating manipulation changes the follow-up dynamic pattern of online ratings. This study empirically identifies manipulated ratings and examines how this manipulation influences the evolution of follow-up ratings over time. Rating records of more than 30,000 restaurants are extracted from the server log of a restaurant review website. The results show a statistically nonsignificant difference in the average rating scores between before and after manipulation, indicating that manipulation does not influence follow-up rating dynamics. Moreover, the difference in average ratings between before and after manipulation decreases within a long time window, which indicates that the long-term effect is weaker than the short-term one. The results are further validated by an online field experiment. We then construct a simulation model to reveal the underlying mechanisms of why the follow-up raters could correct the bias of rating manipulation. The manipulated high-rating score of the vendor will increase the diversity of consumers' individual preferences, which leads to diverse evaluations among users. The aggregation of online ranking by taking the average score of ratings helps form a decentralized climate of opinion and finally helps correct the biased rating. This study challenges the common belief that self-boosting misinformation affects the performance of online commerce. The non-significant effect of rating manipulation on rating dynamics echoes the theory of the wisdom of crowds. Furthermore, this study has managerial implications for both online vendors and online rating platforms. We suggested that the system should degrade social influences among users in order to reduce the possible impacts by manipulated ratings.","[Zhang, Lun] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Arts & Commun, Dept Digital Media, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Sheng-Feng; Lin, Zi-Zhan] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ye] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, 19 XinJieKouWai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China","Wu, Y (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, 19 XinJieKouWai St, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",wuye@bnu.edu.cn,,,"Young Scholar Program of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research, Ministry of Education [18YJC860050]; 2018 S-Tech Research Assistance Plan Internet Communication Project","This work was supported by the Young Scholar Program of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research, Ministry of Education [grant number 18YJC860050] and 2018 S-Tech Research Assistance Plan Internet Communication Project.",,31,6,6,4,20,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0736-5853,,,TELEMAT INFORM,Telemat.

To date, efforts have centered on improving the content, accessibility, and delivery of scientific communications. Here we argue that in the current political and media environment faulty communication is no longer the core of the problem. Distrust in the scientific enterprise and misperceptions of scientific knowledge increasingly stem less from problems of communication and more from the widespread dissemination of misleading and biased information. We describe the profound structural shifts in the media environment that have occurred in recent decades and their connection to public policy decisions and technological changes. We explain how these shifts have enabled unscrupulous actors with ulterior motives increasingly to circulate fake news, misinformation, and disinformation with the help of trolls, bots, and respondent-driven algorithms. We document the high degree of partisan animosity, implicit ideological bias, political polarization, and politically motivated reasoning that now prevail in the public sphere and offer an actual example of how clearly stated scientific conclusions can be systematically perverted in the media through an internet-based campaign of disinformation and misinformation. We suggest that, in addition to attending to the clarity of their communications, scientists must also develop online strategies to counteract campaigns of misinformation and disinformation that will inevitably follow the release of findings threatening to partisans on either end of the political spectrum.","[Iyengar, Shanto] Stanford Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Massey, Douglas S.] Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Massey, DS (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Dept Sociol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",dmassey@princeton.edu,,,"EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENTUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [P2CHD047879, P2CHD047879, P2CHD047879, P2CHD047879, P2CHD047879, P2CHD047879, P2CHD047879, P2CHD047879] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NICHD NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [P2C HD047879] Funding Source: Medline",,,57,39,40,26,92,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Here, we provide an overview of how and why citizens become (and sometimes remain) misinformed about science. Our discussion focuses specifically on misinformation among individual citizens. However, it is impossible to understand individual information processing and acceptance without taking into account social networks, information ecologies, and other macro-level variables that provide important social context. Specifically, we show how being misinformed is a function of a person's ability and motivation to spot falsehoods, but also of other group-level and societal factors that increase the chances of citizens to be exposed to correct(ive) information. We conclude by discussing a number of research areas-some of which echo themes of the 2017 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's Communicating Science Effectively report-that will be particularly important for our future understanding of misinformation, specifically a systems approach to the problem of misinformation, the need for more systematic analyses of science communication in new media environments, and a (re)focusing on traditionally underserved audiences.","[Scheufele, Dietram A.; Krause, Nicole M.] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Dept Life Sci Commun, Madison, WI 53706 USA","Scheufele, DA; Krause, NM (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Dept Life Sci Commun, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",scheufele@wisc.edu; nmkrause@wisc.edu,"Krause, Nicky/AAE-1363-2019; Scheufele, Dietram A./A-8737-2008","Scheufele, Dietram A./0000-0002-9914-5407; Krause, Nicole/0000-0003-0550-9546",,,,96,50,50,41,131,NATL ACAD SCIENCES,WASHINGTON,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",0027-8424,,,P NATL ACAD SCI USA,Proc.

Several important influencing factors are examined and illustrated. User information from the most recent posted microblog content of 3793 Sina Weibo users was collected. Natural language processing (NLP) was used for the sentiment and short text similarity analyses, and four machine learning techniques, i.e., logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were compared on different rumor refuting microblogs; after which a valid and robust distinguishing XGBoost model was trained and validated to predict who would retweet disaster-related rumor refuting microblogs. Compared with traditional prediction variables that only access user information, the similarity and sentiment analyses of the most recent user microblog contents were found to significantly improve prediction precision and robustness. The number of user microblogs also proved to be a valuable reference for all samples during the prediction process. This prediction methodology could be possibly more useful for WeChat or Facebook as these have relatively stable closed-loop communication channels, which means that rumors are more likely to be refuted by acquaintances. Therefore, the methodology is going to be further optimized and validated on WeChat-like channels in the future. The novel rumor refuting approach presented in this research harnessed NLP for the user microblog content analysis and then used the analysis results of NLP as additional prediction variables to identify the anti-rumor spreaders. Therefore, compared to previous studies, this study presents a new and effective decision support for rumor countermeasures.","[Wang, Shihang; Li, Zongmin; Zhang, Qi] Sichuan Univ, Business Sch, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuhong] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Movie & Media, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China","Li, ZM (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Business Sch, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",18280446697@163.com; lizongmin@scu.edu.cn; honglexi@126.com; 13547802519@163.com,"Wang, Shihang/AAE-3533-2019","Li, Zongmin/0000-0002-6000-0171",National Natural Science FoundationsNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71601134]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M612983]; Basic Scientific Research Operating Expenses of Central Universities from Business School of Sichuan University,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundations (Grant No. 71601134), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2017M612983) and Basic Scientific Research Operating Expenses of Central Universities from Business School of Sichuan University.",,38,3,3,4,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1661-7827,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

ResultsOf all the patients, 98.0% showed no postoperative infection-related foreign body reaction or distinct abnormal reaction, and the implants were observed to maintain long-term efficacy until 18-month follow-up. In patients who received spreader grafts, significant differences between preoperative and postoperative Cottle sign scores were found. Histopathological analysis showed features of adjacent tissue infiltration into pores of the PCL mesh and regeneration of neo-cartilaginous tissue and collagen around the mesh 20months after implantation. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that a novel biodegradable PCL mesh with a 3D structure is a safe and effective material for corrective rhinoplasty because it is easy to use and capable of maintaining its volume in the long term without foreign body response. This biocompatible material will have a wide range of applications as the most suitable alternative to nonabsorbable materials in rhinoplasty and reconstruction surgeries, such as fashioning spreader grafts and septal extension grafts.Level of Evidence IVThis journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

The 2017-2019 Italian National Vaccination Plan promotes the improvement of knowledge and attitudes of healthcare workers about vaccine prevention, in order to spread a vaccination culture among general population. Similarly to the General Practitioner, the Pharmacist represents a fundamental forefront for both patients and healthy people, also in promoting vaccine acceptance. This research aims to analyze knowledge and attitudes about vaccines of Community Pharmacists and to evaluate the burden of vaccination counselling during their work activities. Material and methods. A standardized, self-administered and previously validated questionnaire, including 5 sections and 28 items, was submitted to a sample of Community Pharmacists working in Western Sicily. The survey was carried out through an online questionnaire, that investigated socio-demographic data, knowledge and attitudes towards vaccination and the role of the Pharmacist as vaccination counselor during his work. Results. A total of 120 Pharmacists were surveyed. 99.2% of them were definitely agreed with the Regional Vaccination Schedule. A large majority (n = 114, or 95%) were fully vaccinated and have vaccinated, or would vaccinate in future, their children. According to Community Pharmacists interviewed, at least 90% of clients asked for further explanations about vaccination, and the citizens' trust towards vaccination increased (30%) or remained stable (54.2%) over time in the last 5 years. Finally, as reported by interviewed Pharmacists, a correct counselling provided by General Practitioners (GPs) and Family Pediatricians was the main boost in increasing vaccination confidence, instead of mass-media and web misinformation that has led to skepticisms among general population. Conclusions. The study demonstrated the key role of the Community Pharmacist for their consumers in vaccination counselling. In future, a strong collaboration between Community Pharmacists and all the actors promoting vaccination themes (GPs, family Pediatricians, public health workers) will be essential, as well as a uniform and standardized University training on vaccination themes for all these categories.","[Scarpitta, F.; Restivo, V.; Sannasardo, C.

As the largest antimicrobials producer and user in the world, China has a critical role to play in combatting AMR. By examining Chinese news articles and policy statements, we aim to provide an authentic understanding of public discourse in China on AMR.MethodsA search was conducted using two of the most comprehensive digital libraries for Chinese news media documents. Chinese policy documents were retrieved from official Chinese government websites. Records from June 2016 to May 2017 were included. Grounded theory was used to analyze included records, and we followed an iterative thematic synthesis process to categorize the key themes of each document.ResultsAcross 64 news articles, most articles delivered general knowledge about AMR and debunked AMR-related myths, explored the implications of AMR-relevant policies, and discussed the misuse of antimicrobials in the agricultural sector. All policy documents provided guidance for healthcare workers, encouraging them to better manage antimicrobial prescriptions and usage.ConclusionsWhile the Chinese media actively educates the public on strategies for AMR prevention, certain news articles risk misleading readers by downplaying the hazards of domestic AMR issues. Further, although several national policies are geared towards combatting AMR, the government faces difficult challenges in overcoming public misconceptions regarding antimicrobial use. Records from the regional level should also be examined to further explore China's public discourse on AMR.","[Yu, An Yi; Van Katwyk, Susan Rogers; Hoffman, Steven J.] York Univ, Global Strategy Lab, Dahdaleh Inst Global Hlth Res, Fac Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Yu, An Yi; Van Katwyk, Susan Rogers; Hoffman, Steven J.] York Univ, Osgoode Hall Law Sch, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Yu, An Yi; Hoffman, Steven J.] McMaster Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Van Katwyk, Susan Rogers] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Hoffman, Steven J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Hoffman, SJ (corresponding author), York Univ, Global Strategy Lab, Dahdaleh Inst Global Hlth Res, Fac Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Hoffman, SJ (corresponding author), York Univ, Osgoode Hall Law Sch, Toronto, ON, Canada.; Hoffman, SJ (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",annieanyi.yu@mail.utoronto.ca; steven.hoffman@globalstrategylab.org,,"Rogers Van Katwyk, Susan/0000-0002-1758-8635; Hoffman, Steven/0000-0002-2064-3711","Research Council of Norway's Global Health & Vaccination Programme (GLOBVAC Project)Research Council of Norway [234608]; Ontario Graduate ScholarshipOntario Graduate Scholarship; Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Ontario Government's Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science","This project was completed as part of the International Collaboration for Capitalizing on Cost-Effective and Life-Saving Commodities (i4C) that is funded through the Research Council of Norway's Global Health & Vaccination Programme (GLOBVAC Project #234608).

They hold great potential to promote a new generation of wearable devices and thin optical systems for imaging and sensing. However, due to the diffractive nature of these metasurfaces, chromatic aberration represents a critical challenge toward practical implementations, especially for the visible spectrum. Existing solutions for multi-wavelength meta-optics inevitably increase the device thickness and system complexity, similar to the conventional refractive and diffractive counterparts. They are also limited to polarization sensitive lenses with a small size and numerical aperture (NA). In this manuscript, we present the design of single-layer multi-wavelength metasurfaces using ultrathin dielectric resonators (thickness << wavelength) as structural elements. The electromagnetic response of these resonators can be tailored by the in-plane geometrical parameters and used to manipulate the transmitted light. We introduce a digital transmission modulation scheme which enables opportunities to design multi-wavelength optics beyond conventional binary diffractive optics. The design versatility of our approach is demonstrated by polarization-independent achromatic metalenses with a larger lens size and larger NA than existing approaches. The simplicity of the design and fabrication process makes these ultrathin metasurfaces good candidates for building flat optical elements that can be easily integrated onto CMOS electronics and MEMS devices.

Specifically, a couple of a user and an attached device is viewed as a node, and all network nodes are separated into four compartments: Rumor-Neutral, Rumor-Received, Rumor-Believed and Rumor-Denied. Some transition parameters among these groups are introduced. Additionally, the role of memory, user's ability to distinguish the rumors and rumor-denier's behavior of refuting rumors are also incorporated. The stability of the equilibria of the model system is addressed, and the influence of model parameters upon the threshold is analyzed. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results, and also motivate us to propose suitable measures to control cyber rumor spreading by properly adjusting the parameter values.

This paper explores two case studies of pro-vaccine activism in Australia and the United States (US). It shows how pro-vaccine views and behaviours can take varying forms due to different aims and methods of engagement - oppositional counter-activities in favour of vaccination in Australia, and issue-based advocacy as part of a political alliance in the US. The focus in Australia comes from a pro-science stance and includes 'skeptics' against pseudoscience directly opposing vaccine-critical groups. In the US, the focus takes the form of an issue-specific campaign that has arisen from existing pro-vaccine parent blogs and discussion groups pushing for policy change rather than public confrontation. These case studies exemplify how pro-vaccine activism can take varying forms of either reinforcing the mainstream view or countering digression from it. Drawing on qualitative research, this paper aims to examine the types of practices and strategies employed by activists to voice their support of vaccination, and discusses the means, messages, and motivations of pro-vaccine activism. It ends with an argument for why a study - of public support for in addition to studying public opposition to vaccination - can help to better understand vaccination views and behaviours. These findings have wider implications for the study of counter-activism and the polarisation of civil society groups.","[Vanderslott, Samantha] Univ Oxford, Oxford Vaccine Grp, 34 Broad St, Oxford OX1 2BD, England; [Vanderslott, Samantha] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, 34 Broad St, Oxford OX1 2BD, England","Vanderslott, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Vaccine Grp, 34 Broad St, Oxford OX1 2BD, England.; Vanderslott, S (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, 34 Broad St, Oxford OX1 2BD, England.",samantha.vanderslott@paediatrics.ox.ac.uk,,"Vanderslott, Samantha/0000-0001-8685-7758",Oxford Martin School programme on 'Collective Responsibility for Infectious Disease'; Linacre College Oxford,"I would like to thank my interviewees who gave up their time to speak with me and also sent relevant materials.

In the public health domain specifically, treatment misinformation can lead to opportunity costs or direct harm. Alas, attempts to debunk misinformation have proven sub-optimal, and have even been shown to backfire, including increasing misperceptions. Thus, optimized debunking strategies have been developed to more effectively combat misinformation. The aim of this study was to test these strategies in a real-world setting, targeting misinformation about autism interventions. In the context of professional development training, we randomly assigned participants to an optimized-debunking or a treatment-as-usual training condition and compared support for non-empirically-supported treatments before, after, and six weeks following completion of online training. Results demonstrated greater benefits of optimized debunking immediately after training; thus, the implemented strategies can serve as a general and flexible debunking template.

We have characterized this online interest in using cannabis as a cancer treatment and the propagation of this information on social media. Materials & methods We compared search activity over time for cannabis and cancer versus standard cancer therapies using Google Trends' relative search volume (RSV) tool and determined the impact of cannabis legalization. We classified news on social media about cannabis use in cancer as false, accurate, or irrelevant. We evaluated the cannabis-related social media activities of cancer organizations. Results The online search volume for cannabis and cancer increased at 10 times the rate of standard therapies (RSV 0.10/month versus 0.01/month, p<0.001), more so in states where medical or recreational cannabis is legal. The use of cannabis as a cancer cure represented the largest category (23.5%) of social media content on alternative cancer treatments. The top false news story claiming cannabis as a cancer cure generated 4.26 million engagements on social media, while the top accurate news story debunking this false news generated 0.036 million engagements. Cancer organizations infrequently addressed cannabis (average 0.7 Tweets; 0.4 Facebook posts), with low influence compared to false news (average 5.6 versus 527 Twitter retweets; 98 versus 452,050 Facebook engagements, p<0.001).

Design/methodology/approach This study used a mixed-method approach, using a brand situation as a case example, including sentiment analysis of social media conversations and sentiment analysis of media coverage. This study tracks the diffusion of a false claim about the brand via online media coverage, subsequent spreading of the false claim via social media and the resulting impact on sentiment toward the brand. Findings The findings illustrate the influence of digital mass communication sources on the subsequent spread of information about a brand via social media channels and the impact of the social spread of false claims on brand sentiment. This study illustrates the value of social media listening and sentiment analysis for brands as an ongoing business practice. Research limitations/implications - While it has long been known that media coverage is in part subsequently diffused through individual sharing, this study reveals the potential for media sentiment to influence sentiment toward a brand. It also illustrates the potential harm brands face when false information is spread via media coverage and subsequently through social media posts and conversations. How brands can most effectively correct false brand beliefs and recover from negative sentiment related to false claims is an area for future research. Practical implications - This study suggests that brands are wise to use sentiment analysis as part of their evaluation of earned media coverage from news organizations and to use social listening as an alert system and sentiment analysis to assess impact on attitudes toward the brand. These steps should become part of a brand's social media management process. Social implications - Media are presumed to be impartial reporters of news and information. However, this study illustrated that the sentiment expressed in media coverage about a brand can be measured and diffused beyond the publications' initial reach via social media. Advertising positioned as news must be labeled as  advertorial to ensure that those exposed to the message understand that the message is not impartial. News organizations may inadvertently publish false claims and relay information with sentiment that is then carried via social media along with the information itself.

The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011 can be viewed as an example of the role and responsibility the professional media has to take on in the age of the digital revolution. A limited empirical evaluation of German news media coverage during the nuclear emergency response serves as a case study here. By reflecting on decision-making processes at ZEIT ONLINE, being one of the largest platforms for online journalism in the German-speaking countries, five paradoxes and implications are discussed. Today the ability to report immediately includes the obligation to do so, with all its shortcomings. Journalists have to precisely tell users, readers, and viewers what they know and what they do not know as well as constantly correct mistakes and clarify circumstances. Additionally, as debunking misinformation can easily strengthen the belief in false facts, accurate and transparent reporting without speculation is essential. Science and facts can help people make informed decisions when presented in a way that embraces unknowns and explains behavioral patterns. But science cannot only prove a point but also be used to manipulate truth. Therefore, journalists and scientists need to work together-respecting a professional distance-to value their shared asset of credibility. To report facts truthfully and to report the truth about a fact is a process that has to be refined and adapted constantly.","[Stockrahm, Sven] ZEIT ONLINE, Sci & Digital News, Berlin, Germany","Stockrahm, S (corresponding author), ZEIT ONLINE, Sci & Digital News, Berlin, Germany.",sven.stockrahm@zeit.de,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2364-8333,2364-8341,978-981-13-8327-4; 978-981-13-8326-7,CURR TOP ENV HEAL PR,,,2019,,,,,,,121,130,,10.1007/978-981-13-8327-4_10,10.1007/978-981-13-8327-4,,10,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nuclear Science & Technology","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nuclear Science & Technology",BO2KQ,WOS:000506026500010,,,,,2020-12-18,

With approximately six million (11%) of the UK population now listening to podcasts in an average week, the podcast renaissance raises new questions about the relationship between cultural production, consumption and representation. This paper explores the significance of the new wave of podcasts, specifically with regards to racial politics in the UK and its potential power as an anti-racist tool. Through a series of interview and focus group discussions with black and Asian podcasters in the UK, it asks what role podcasts play in providing an alternative space for `communities of resistance'. These issues are examined against the dual contexts in the UK of an intensifyingly hostile environment for black and minority ethnic groups and a digital and creative sector marked by social and cultural inequalities. The article suggests that in a `post fact' international climate of disinformation that bolsters populist rhetoric around minority cultural groups, podcasts have become a rare space for articulating the lived experiences of these groups, whilst also challenging broader patterns of racialized disenfranchisement, including in the creative industries. Podcasts facilitate new forms of social affiliation and antiracism; which we analyse through Fraser's concept of subaltern counterpublics to unveil the interruptive potentiality of the medium for marginalised communities seeking to make accessible alternative representations and perspectives on the relationship between race and society.","[Vrikki, Photini; Malik, Sarita] Brunel Univ London, Dept Social & Polit Sci, London UB8 3PN, England","Vrikki, P (corresponding author), Brunel Univ London, Dept Social & Polit Sci, London UB8 3PN, England.",Photini.vrikki@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,30,1,1,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-5702,1540-5710,,POP COMMUN,Pop.

Exactly how they might leverage that trust remains unclear and untested. Building on recent work in correcting health misperceptions on social media, this study tests whether libraries can leverage trust to combat misinformation online. Using a misperception about the influenza vaccine as a test case, an experiment (n = 625) was conducted in fall 2018 using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Results suggest that the misperception can be reduced, but not by library institutions. An unsuccessful follow-up (n = 600) suggests that the effectiveness of the correction is season dependent and opens the possibility that libraries may yet play a role, but not necessarily because they are trusted. Future library proposals for combating misinformation need to be developed and tested within a broader contemporary misinformation research program.","[Sullivan, M.

Adolescent community and academic researchers conducted focus group discussions with 94 adolescents aged 10-19 years old, and in-depth interviews with five females who had been pregnant in adolescence and one male who had fathered an adolescent pregnancy. Data was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Content analysis was employed to analyze the data. Two themes emerged about the adolescents: 1) social situations to rationalize sexual behaviors, which comprised peer imitation regarding sexual intercourse, online sexual relationships, drinking alcohol before having sex, living with a boyfriend/girlfriend without marriage, and having multiple partners, and 2) factors related to sexual risk behaviors, including adolescent norms regarding sexual risk, misinformation regarding sexual risk prevention, uninvolved parenting style, lack of teaching skills to convey sex education, potential risk environment in the community, and community norms regarding males' sexual behavior. Results indicated that correct and effective sexually transmitted infection prevention methods, gender equality, and motivation for condom use are important to prevent adolescent sexual risk behaviors. In addition, community-based interventions are needed to focus on different parenting skills, sex education teaching skills, and addressing community norms in order to prevent sexual risk behaviors among Thai adolescents.","[Settheekul, Saowaluck; Fongkaew, Warunee; Viseskul, Nongkran] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Nursing, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Boonchieng, Waraporn] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Publ Hlth, Chiang Mai, Thailand; [Voss, Joachim G.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Frances Payne Bolton Sch Nursing, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA","Fongkaew, W (corresponding author), Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Nursing, Chiang Mai, Thailand.",rai_2185@hotmail.com; warunee.fo@gmail.com; viseskul@gmail.com; waraporn@boonchieng.net; jgv20@case.edu,"Voss, Joachim/AAA-1277-2020",/0000-0003-3749-9143,National Research University Project under Thailand's Office of Higher Education Commission [NRU58_WF_Adolescents]; CMU 50th Anniversary PhD Grant from Chiang Mai University,The authors are thankful to our community researchers for their commitment to working with us throughout the research project and are grateful to all the research participants for sharing their value experiences.

Health organizations are required to respond and correct the information to gain the public's trust and influence it to follow the recommended instructions. Objectives (1) To examine ways for health organizations to correct misinformation concerning the measles vaccination on social networks for two groups: pro-vaccination and hesitant; (2) To examine the types of reactions of two subgroups (pro-vaccination, hesitant) to misinformation correction; and (3) To examine the effect of misinformation correction on these two subgroups regarding reliability, satisfaction, self-efficacy and intentions. Methods A controlled experiment with participants divided randomly into two conditions. In both experiment conditions a dilemma was presented as to sending a child to kindergarten, followed by an identical Facebook post voicing the children mothers' concerns. In the third stage the correction by the health organization is presented differently in two conditions: Condition 1 -common information correction, and Condition 2-recommended (theory-based) information correction, mainly communicating information transparently and addressing the public's concerns. The study included (n = 243) graduate students from the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at Haifa University. Results A statistically significant difference was found in the reliability level attributed to information correction by the Health Ministry between the Control condition and Experimental condition (sig<0.001), with the average reliability level of the subjects in Condition 2 (M = 5.68) being considerably higher than the average reliability level of subjects in Condition 1 (4.64). A significant difference was found between Condition 1 and Condition 2 (sig<0.001), with the average satisfaction from the Health Ministry's response of Condition 2 subjects (M = 5.75) being significantly higher than the average satisfaction level of Condition 1 subjects (4.66). Similarly, when we tested the pro and hesitant groups separately, we found that both preferred the response presented in Condition 2. Conclusion It is very important for the organizations to correct misinformation transparently, and to address the emotional aspects for both the pro-vaccination and the hesitant groups. The pro-vaccination group is not a captive audience, and it too requires a full response that addresses the public's fears and concerns.","[Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat; Diamant, Alon] Univ Haifa, Hlth & Risk Commun Res Ctr, Haifa, Israel; [Gesser-Edelsburg, Anat; Hijazi, Rana] Univ Haifa, Sch Publ Hlth, Haifa, Israel; [Mesch, Gustavo S.] Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol, Haifa, Israel","Gesser-Edelsburg, A (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Hlth & Risk Commun Res Ctr, Haifa, Israel.; Gesser-Edelsburg, A (corresponding author), Univ Haifa, Sch Publ Hlth, Haifa, Israel.",ageser@univ.haifa.ac.il,"mesch, gustavo/W-9537-2019; Mesch, Gustavo S./ABA-6420-2020","Gesser-Edelsburg, PhD, Prof. Anat/0000-0003-4467-8799",,,,80,13,12,1,17,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,DEC 19,2018,13,12,,,,,,,e0209505,10.1371/journal.pone.0209505,,,23,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,HE9NT,WOS:000453779300093,30566485,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-18,

Background: Society is facing a significant challenge from the spread of misinformation through websites and social media that has driven a divergence in people's perceptions and understanding of basic facts associated with many issues relevant to public policy decisions, including the economy, taxation, and the deficit; climate change and the environment; and vaccinations and public health and safety. A number of factors are driving this fracture, including information presentation challenges that lead to poor information understanding, deliberate information attacks, social network propagation, poor assessments of information reliability, and cognitive biases that lead to a rejection of information that conflicts with preexisting beliefs. Results: A framework for understanding information attack is provided, including common sources, features, avenues, cognitive mechanisms, and major challenges in overcoming information attacks.

Here we demonstrate one mechanism that contributes to the believability of fake news: fluency via prior exposure. Using actual fake-news headlines presented as they were seen on Facebook, we show that even a single exposure increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy, both within the same session and after a week. Moreover, this illusory truth effect for fake-news headlines occurs despite a low level of overall believability and even when the stories are labeled as contested by fact checkers or are inconsistent with the reader's political ideology. These results suggest that social media platforms help to incubate belief in blatantly false news stories and that tagging such stories as disputed is not an effective solution to this problem. It is interesting, however, that we also found that prior exposure does not impact entirely implausible statements (e.g., The earth is a perfect square). These observations indicate that although extreme implausibility is a boundary condition of the illusory truth effect, only a small degree of potential plausibility is sufficient for repetition to increase perceived accuracy. As a consequence, the scope and impact of repetition on beliefs is greater than has been previously assumed.","[Pennycook, Gordon; Cannon, Tyrone D.; Rand, David G.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Rand, David G.] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Rand, David G.] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Rand, David G.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Rand, David G.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Pennycook, G (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Fac Business Adm, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",grpennycook@gmail.com,"Pennycook, Gordon/AAD-6631-2019","Pennycook, Gordon/0000-0003-1344-6143","Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship; National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [MH081902]; Templeton World Charity Foundation; Defense Advanced Research Projects AgencyUnited States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902, U01MH081902] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This research was supported by a Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship (to Gordon Pennycook), National Institute of Mental Health Grant MH081902 (to Tyrone D.

Communication, cognitive, social, and computer scientists are studying the complex causes for the viral diffusion of misinformation, while online platforms are beginning to deploy countermeasures. Little systematic, data-based evidence has been published to guide these efforts. Here we analyze 14 million messages spreading 400 thousand articles on Twitter during ten months in 2016 and 2017. We find evidence that social bots played a disproportionate role in spreading articles from low-credibility sources. Bots amplify such content in the early spreading moments, before an article goes viral. They also target users with many followers through replies and mentions. Humans are vulnerable to this manipulation, resharing content posted by bots. Successful low-credibility sources are heavily supported by social bots. These results suggest that curbing social bots may be an effective strategy for mitigating the spread of online misinformation.","[Shao, Chengcheng; Varol, Onur; Yang, Kai-Cheng; Flammini, Alessandro; Menczer, Filippo] Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Shao, Chengcheng] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Comp, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Ciampaglia, Giovanni Luca; Flammini, Alessandro; Menczer, Filippo] Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA","Menczer, F (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.; Menczer, F (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Network Sci Inst, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.",fil@iu.edu,"Shao, Chengcheng/AAF-6734-2019; Varol, Onur/T-6764-2019","Shao, Chengcheng/0000-0002-5479-2256; Varol, Onur/0000-0002-3994-6106; Yang, Kai-Cheng/0000-0003-4627-9273","China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council; IUNI; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1735095, 1101743]; DARPAUnited States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [W911NF-12-1-0037]; Democracy Fund [R-RR-201705-01961]; James S.

At the same time, unverified and instrumentally relevant information statements in circulation, named as rumours, are becoming a potential threat to the society. For this reason, although the identification in social microblogs of which topic is a rumour has been studied in several works, there is the need to detect if a post is either a rumor or not. In this paper we cope with this last challenge presenting a novel rumour detection system that leverages on newly designed features, including influence potential and network characteristics measures. We tested our approach on a real dataset composed of health-related posts collected from Twitter microblog. We observe promising results, as the system is able to correctly detect about 90% of rumours, with acceptable levels of precision. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This new revolution will be digital fabrication technology. The digital IT revolution has been largely driven by digital algorithms such as error detection and correction and Moore's Law which has given us an exponential trend in product capabilities. However, the longstanding trend in improving manufacturing precision which has enabled Moore's Law simply cannot be continued much longer because we are running into the limits imposed by the quantized nature of matter. At this scale, matter can no longer be treated in an analogue fashion i.e. as an infinitely divisible medium, but must be treated as an integer number of discrete atomic distances, i.e. in a digital fashion. By embracing this digital nature of matter, we can conceive of a digital fabrication technology, where the digital processes are the making and breaking of chemical bonds, there is a digital address grid that is spatial in nature, and error detection and correction processes can be developed. This digital fabrication technology will have the similarly huge advantages over analog fabrication that digital IT has over analog IT. We remind the reader that effective digital technologies are not exclusively digital in their operation. Digital electronics is carried out by analog transistors that are embedded in circuitry designed to accept their output in a digital fashion. Digital fabrication technology is not synonymous with Atomically Precise Manufacturing (APM) but should lead to that important capability. Furthermore this digital fabrication technology will start a new exponential manufacturing trend that will replace Moore's law and will not be just for information processing and therefore will have an even larger impact than Moore's Law. Like any exponential trend Digital Fabrication will start slowly in a few niche markets, but the time for investing in the development of this new technology is now. (c) 2018 The Authors.

The process inconsistency leads to anomalies in the build, which hinders AM's broader adoption to critical structural component manufacturing. Therefore, it is crucial to detect any process change/anomaly in a timely and accurate manner for potential corrective operations. Real-time thermal image streams captured from AM processes are regarded as most informative signatures of the process stability. Existing state-of-the-art studies on thermal image streams focus merely on in situ sensing, feature extraction, and their relationship with process setup parameters and material properties. The objective of this paper is to develop a statistical process control (SPC) approach to detect process changes as soon as it occurs based on predefined distribution of the monitoring statistics. There are two major challenges: 1) complex spatial interdependence exists in the thermal images and current engineering knowledge is not sufficient to describe all the variability, and 2) the thermal images suffer from a large data volume, a low signal-to-noise ratio, and an ill structure with missing data. To tackle these challenges, multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) approach is used to extract low dimensional features and residuals. Subsequently, an online dual control charting system is proposed by leveraging multivariate T-2 and Q control charts to detect changes in extracted low dimensional features and residuals, respectively. A real-world case study of thin wall fabrication using a Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) process is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the accuracy of process anomaly detection is validated based on X-ray computed tomography information collected from the final build offline.","[Khanzadeh, Mojtaba; Tian, Wenmeng; Bian, Linkan] Mississippi State Univ, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, Starkville, MS 39759 USA; [Yadollahi, Aref; Doude, Haley R.; Bian, Linkan] Mississippi State Univ, CAVS, Starkville, MS 39762 USA; [Tschopp, Mark A.] US Army Res Lab, Chicago, IL 60615 USA","Bian, LK (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Ind & Syst Engn Dept, Starkville, MS 39759 USA.; Bian, LK (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, CAVS, Starkville, MS 39762 USA.",bian@ise.msstate.edu,"Khanzadeh, Mojtaba/X-2476-2019","Doude, Haley/0000-0002-9211-9177",Army Research LaboratoryUnited States Department of DefenseUS Army Research Laboratory (ARL) [W911NF-15-2-0025],"Research was sponsored by the Army Research Laboratory and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-15-2-0025.

Previous works often dealt with either individuals' trust in rumors or their willingness to share. Juxtaposing both in the same study, the aim of this paper is to investigate medical professionals' intentions to trust and share online health rumors as a function of their personal involvement, the rumor type, and the presence of counter rumors. Personal involvement refers to individuals' perceived relevance of a rumor. Two common types of rumors include dread and wish. Counter-rumors are messages that debunk rumors. A within-participants experiment was conducted with 60 participants, divided evenly among doctors, nurses and medical students, each of whom was exposed to eight cancer-related rumors. Rumor type and the presence of counter-rumors were induced. Personal involvement, intention to trust, and intention to share were measured using a questionnaire. Results showed that personal involvement compelled intentions to trust and share. Dread rumors triggered intentions to trust and share more than did wish rumors. The presence of counter-rumors lowered intention to trust, but not intention to share. Moreover, rumor type moderated the relation between personal involvement and intentions to trust and share.","[Chua, Alton Y.

This aspect of information seeking is important, especially for people affected by chronic pathologies and require lifelong treatment and management. These people are usually very well informed about the disease but are nonetheless vulnerable to hopes of being cured or saved, often amplified by misinformation, myths, legends, and therapies that are not always scientifically proven. Many studies suggest that some individuals prefer to rely on the Internet as their main source of information, often hindering the patient-doctor relationship. A professional approach is imperative to maintain confidentiality, honesty, and trust in the medical profession. Objective: we aimed to examine, in a medically supervised Italian web community (SMsocialnetwotk.com ) dedicated to people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), the posts shared by users and to verify the reliability of contents of posts shared by users pinpointed as Influencers through an online questionnaire. Methods: we grouped the posts published on SMsocialnetwork from April to June 2015 into those with medical content (scientifically correct or fake news), and those related to social interactions. Later, we gave a questionnaire to the community asking to identify the three users/Influencers providing the most reliable advice for everyday life with MS and the three users/Influencers providing the most useful information about MS treatments. Results: 308 posts reported scientific and relevant medical information, whereas 72 posts included pieces of fake news. 1420 posts were of general interest. Four out of the 6 Influencers had written only posts with correct medical information (3 were pwMS, 1 was a Neurologist) and never any fake news. The remaining 2 appointed Influencers (2 pwMS) had written only posts about general interests. Conclusion: the identification of fake news and their authors has shown that the latter are never appointed as Influencers. SMsocialnetwork.com acted as a web safe environment where the Influencers contributed by sharing only correct medical information and never fake news. We speculate that the presence of neurologists and psychologists supervising the information flow might have contributed to reduce the risk of fake news spreading and to avoid their acquisition of authoritative meaning.","[Lavorgna, L.; De Stefano, M.; Sparaco, M.; Abbadessa, G.; Montella, P.; Buonanno, D.; Esposito, S.; Trojsi, F.; Ippolito, D.; Bisecco, A.; Tedeschi, G.; Bonavita, S.] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Clin Neurol 1, Piazza Miraglia 2, I-80138 Naples, Italy; [Moccia, M.; Lanzillo, R.; Rosa, L.; Morra, V.

Gynecologic cancers have become one of the most serious threats to women's health in China. With the widespread use of social media, an increasing number of individuals have employed social media to produce, seek, and share cancer-related information. However, health information on social media is not always accurate. Health, and especially cancer-related, misinformation has been widely spread on social media, which can affect individuals' attitudinal and behavioral responses to cancer. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the nature and diffusion of gynecologic cancer-related misinformation on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Methods: A total of 2691 tweets related to 2 gynecologic cancers-breast cancer and cervical cancer-posted on Weibo from June 2015 to June 2016 were extracted using the Python Web Crawler. Two medical school graduate students with expertise in gynecologic diseases were recruited to code the tweets to differentiate between true information and misinformation as well as to identify the types of falsehoods. The diffusion characteristics of gynecologic cancer-related misinformation were compared with those of the true information. Results: While most of the gynecologic cancer-related tweets provided medically accurate information, approximately 30% of them were found to contain misinformation. Furthermore, it was found that tweets about cancer treatment contained a higher percentage of misinformation than prevention-related tweets. Nevertheless, the prevention-related misinformation diffused significantly more broadly and deeply than true information on social media. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest the need for controlling and reducing the cancer-related misinformation on social media with the efforts from both service providers and medical professionals. More specifically, it is important to correct falsehoods related to the prevention of gynecologic cancers on social media and increase individuals' capacity to assess the veracity of Web-based information to curb the spread and thus minimize the consequences of cancer-related misinformation.","[Chen, Liang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Commun & Design, Lab Big Data & Publ Commun, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaohui] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Sch Commun, Dept Journalism, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Peng, Tai-Quan] Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, 404 Wilson Rd,Room 473, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Peng, TQ (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, 404 Wilson Rd,Room 473, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",pengtaiq@msu.edu,"Peng, Tai-Quan/B-3176-2011","Peng, Tai-Quan/0000-0002-2588-7491; wang, xiaohui/0000-0003-2126-1712",,,,43,12,12,1,22,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

Methods: To determine which online forums to use, Google was searched using five common childhood ailments. Forums that appeared five or more times in the first five pages of the Google search for each question were considered. Of these forums, those that met the inclusion criteria were used. Data from a six-month time period was collected and categorized from the discussion forums to analyze the advice being provided about common childhood ailments. Evidence-based resources were used to analyze the accuracy of the advice provided. Results: Two discussion forums were chosen for analysis. Seventy-four questions from one and 131 questions from the other were health related. Data were not analyzed together. Of the health-related questions on the 2 forums, 65.5% and 51.8%, respectively, provided some type of advice. Of the advice provided, 54.1% and 47.2%, respectively, agreed with the evidence provided in evidence-based resources. A further 16.2% and 6.3% was refuted or was somewhat refuted by the evidence found in evidence-based resources. Conclusion: While roughly half of the health-related advice provided in online discussion forums aimed at parents of young children is accurate, only a small portion of the advice is incorrect; therefore, these sources are not a major concern for the spread of misinformation.","[Farrell, Alison] Mem Univ Newfoundland, Hlth Sci Lib, St John, NF, Canada","Farrell, A (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Hlth Sci Lib, St John, NF, Canada.",alisonr@mun.ca,"Farrell, Alison/C-5101-2014","Farrell, Alison/0000-0001-8111-5616",,,,15,3,4,1,2,MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOC,CHICAGO,"65 EAST WACKER PLACE, STE 1900, CHICAGO, IL 60601-7298 USA",1536-5050,,,J MED LIBR ASSOC,J.

However, this increasing abundance of data requires supercomputers faster and more powerful than were ever built without the need to build a nuclear plant next to each one! Single flux quantum (SFQ) technology has the potential to meet those booming demands for lower power consumption and higher operation speeds in the electronics industry and future exascale supercomputing systems. Nevertheless, the promised benefits of three orders of magnitude lower power at an order of magnitude higher performance have yet to be attained. In particular, variability and scalability have been long-term obstacles for the technology to advance, compete, and replace the well-founded Silicon CMOS. Notwithstanding that SFQ fabrication has quite improved over the past two decades, its level of variability has to be taken into design consideration. Moreover, the absence of an established tools flow hinders the scalability and the automatibility, which are among the trumps of CMOS technology in digital VLSI. Specifically, as a consequence, ultra-high-speed clocking of large-scale SFQ circuits in the presence of large levels of variability represents a tough obstacle for the technology to advance. In this paper, we propose an innovative self-adaptive clocking technique, which is designed to be resilient in such uncertain environments. Whereas the traditional balanced tree zero-skew clocking is not reliable for large-scale SFQ designs, our proposed hierarchical chains of homogeneous clover-leaves clocking inherits its robustness from spatially correlated cell delays and from the timing robustness of the SFQ traditional counter-flow clocking. Our simulations on ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits show that our robust clocking costs can be on average within 34% as fast as ideal zero-skew jitter-free clock trees with an average area overhead of 58%. Moreover, lower area overhead is also possible at the cost of performance, demonstrating the possible trade-off between performance and area. We assert that these overheads are acceptable given the benefits of more reliable functionality, as quantified by yield, as well as improved scalability. In particular, previous efforts reported that a similar, but more limited, clocking structure leads to up to 93% higher yield than zero-skew clock trees.","[Tadros, Rainy N.; Beerel, Peter A.] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Beerel, Peter A.] Reduced Energy Microsyst, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA","Tadros, RN (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.",rtadros@usc.edu; pabeerel@usc.edu,,,"Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, via the U.S. Army Research Office [W911NF-17-1-0120]","The research is based upon work supported by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, via the U.S. Army Research Office under Grant W911NF-17-1-0120.",,58,8,8,1,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1051-8223,1558-2515,,IEEE T APPL SUPERCON,IEEE Trans.

In this paper, we propose an integrated methodology for the data collection, the reconstruction, the analysis and the visualization of the development of a country's political landscape from Twitter data. Method The proposed method relies solely on the interactions between Twitter accounts and is independent of the characteristics of the shared contents such as the language of the tweets. We validate our methodology on a case study on the 2017 French presidential election (60 million Twitter exchanges between more than 2.4 million users) via two independent methods: the comparison between our automated political categorization and a human categorization based on the evaluation of a sample of 5000 profiles descriptions; the correspondence between the reconfigurations detected in the reconstructed political landscape and key political events reported in the media. This latter validation demonstrated the ability of our approach to accurately reflect the reconfigurations at play in the off-line political scene. Results We built on this reconstruction to give insights into the opinion dynamics and the reconfigurations of political communities at play during a presidential election. First, we propose a quantitative description and analysis of the political engagement of members of political communities. Second, we analyze the impact of political communities on information diffusion and in particular on their role in the fake news phenomena. We measure a differential echo chamber effect on the different types of political news (fake news, debunks, standard news) caused by the community structure and emphasize the importance of addressing the meso-structures of political networks in understanding the fake news phenomena. Conclusions Giving access to an intermediate level, between sociological surveys in the field and large statistical studies (such as those conducted by national or international organizations) we demonstrate that social networks data make it possible to qualify and quantify the activity of political communities in a multi-polar political environment; as well as their temporal evolution and reconfiguration, their structure, their alliance strategies and their semantic particularities during a presidential campaign through the analysis of their digital traces. We conclude this paper with a comment on the political and ethical implications of the use of social networks data in politics. We stress the importance of developing social macroscopes that will enable citizens to better understand how they collectively make society and propose as example the Politoscope, a macroscope that delivers some of our results in an interactive way.","[Gaumont, Noe; Chavalarias, David] Ecole Hautes Etud EHESS, CNRS, CAMS, Paris, France; [Panahi, Maziyar; Chavalarias, David] CNRS, ISC PIF, Paris, France","Chavalarias, D (corresponding author), Ecole Hautes Etud EHESS, CNRS, CAMS, Paris, France.; Chavalarias, D (corresponding author), CNRS, ISC PIF, Paris, France.",david.chavalarias@ehess.fr,,"Chavalarias, David/0000-0001-9485-1399",CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Complex Systems Institute of Paris IIe-de-France; ANR project AlgodivFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-15-CE38-0001]; NoeA Gaumont's Post-Doc; Region IIe-de-France through the Domaine d'Interet Majeur Problematique Transversales aux Systemes Complexes DIM (Field of major interest) from the IIe-de-France Region; City of ParisRegion Ile-de-France,"This work has been supported by the CNRS (http://cnrs.fr), as hosting institution and financer of the PI David Chavalarias and Maziyar Panahi; The Complex Systems Institute of Paris IIe-de-France (https://iscpif.fr), that hosted the team and provided computing infrastructure; the ANR project Algodiv (ANR-15-CE38-0001, http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr), workpackage leader for CAMS David Chavalarias, that financed NoeA Gaumont's Post-Doc; The Region IIe-de-France through the Domaine d'Interet Majeur Problematique Transversales aux Systemes Complexes DIM (Field of major interest) from the IIe-de-France Region that co-funded the IT infrastructure; and The Science en Poche project funded by the City of Paris (Programme Emergence(s), PI David Chavalarias, https://www.paris.fr) that financed the Multivac software development.

We recently showed that most health professionals misinterpret the frequencies of listed side effects as solely caused by the drug. The present study investigated whether (1) these misinterpretations also prevail among laypeople and (2) alternative PLs reduce these misinterpretations. Methods In March 2017, 397 out of 400 laypeople approached completed an online survey. They were randomized to one of four PL formats: three alternative PLs (drug facts box with/without reading instruction, narrative format with numbers) and one standard PL. Each PL listed four side effects for a fictitious drug: two were presented as occurring more often, one as equally often, and one as less often with drug intake. The alternative formats (interventions) included information on frequencies with and without drug intake and included a statement on the causal relation. The standard PL (control) only included information on frequency ranges with drug intake. Questions were asked on general occurrence and causality of side effects. Results Participants randomized to the standard PL were unable to answer questions on causality. For side effects occurring more often (equally; less often) with drug intake, only 1.9% to 2.8% (equally: 1.9%; less often: 1.9%) provided correct responses about the causal nature of side effects, compared to 55.0% to 81.9% (equally: 23.8% to 70.5%; less often: 21.0% to 43.2%) of participants who received alternative PLs. It remains unclear whether one alternative format is superior to the others. Conclusion In conclusion, information on the frequency of side effects in current package leaflets is misleading. Comparative presentation of frequencies for side effects with and without drug intake including statements on the causal relation significantly improves understanding.","[Muehlbauer, Viktoria; Muehlhauser, Ingrid] Univ Hamburg, MIN Fac, Hlth Sci & Educ, Hamburg, Germany; [Prinz, Roman; Wegwarth, Odette] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Harding Ctr Risk Literacy, Berlin, Germany; [Wegwarth, Odette] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Rat, Berlin, Germany","Muhlbauer, V (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, MIN Fac, Hlth Sci & Educ, Hamburg, Germany.",viktoria.muehlbauer@uni-hamburg.de,,,Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development (Germany),Allowance for participants was paid from budgetary resources of the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development (Germany).

But do we lead our readers to draw a causal conclusion unintentionally by explaining why significant correlations and relationships may exist? Here we perform a randomized controlled experiment in a massive open online course run in 2013 that teaches data analysis concepts to test the hypothesis that explaining an analysis will lead readers to interpret an inferential analysis as causal. We test this hypothesis with a single example of an observational study on the relationship between smoking and cancer. We show that adding an explanation to the description of an inferential analysis leads to a 15.2% increase in readers interpreting the analysis as causal (95% confidence interval for difference in two proportions: 12.8%-17.5%). We then replicate this finding in a second large scale massive open online course. Nearly every scientific study, regardless of the study design, includes an explanation for observed effects. Our results suggest that these explanations may be misleading to the audience of these data analyses and that qualification of explanations could be a useful avenue of exploration in future research to counteract the problem.

Materials and methods: A study cast of abutment tooth 46 was made from type-IV dental stone and was scanned to create a standard triangulation language file. Arrays of one (ORM), three (TRM), and six (SRM) resin copings were then fabricated on the mu-SLA build platform using investment, burnout, and casting (n = 12). The marginal and internal gaps of these metal copings were measured using a silicone-replica technique with a digital microscope (x160). The data obtained were analyzed using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H test, a post-hoc Mann-Whitney U test, and a Bonferroni correction. Results: The mean and standard deviation of the marginal gap for each group were measured and found to be 81.1 and 53.2 mu m, 68.3 and 44.8 mu m, and 90.3 and 57.7 mu m for ORM, TRM, and SRM, respectively. There were no statistical differences in the marginal gaps of the three groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The marginal and internal gap of ORM, TRM and SRM groups were considered clinically acceptable.

A typical wireless sensing system, however, may require considerable complexity to perform the necessary analog to digital conversion and subsequent wireless transmission. Alternatively, in the case of inductive link based systems, large, manually operated impedance analyzers are required. Based on a detailed analysis of the link impedance, this paper proposes a simple method for wireless capacitive sensing through an inductive link that uses a self-oscillator and a frequency counter. The method enables changes in capacitance to be sensed and wirelessly transmitted simultaneously. In order to test the effectiveness of the method, a self-oscillating circuit was designed and fabricated in 0.18 mu m CMOS, and combined with an on-chip humidity sensing capacitor. The system was tested in a humidity chamber across a range of 20-90% rh. Measured results from the system demonstrate that capacitive changes as small as 28 fF, translating to <2% rh, can be resolved, with a power consumption of 1.44 mW.","[Schormans, Matthew; Valente, Virgilio; Demosthenous, Andreas] UCL, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London WC1E 7JE, England; [Valente, Virgilio] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Microelect, NL-2628 Delft, Netherlands","Schormans, M (corresponding author), UCL, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London WC1E 7JE, England.",matthew.schormans.10@ucl.ac.uk; valente@tudelft.nl; a.demosthenous@ucl.ac.uk,"Valente, Virgilio/W-5434-2019","Demosthenous, Andreas/0000-0003-0623-963X; Schormans, Matthew/0000-0001-6149-5180","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K031953/1, EP/M506448/1]",This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under Grants EP/K031953/1 and EP/M506448/1.,,27,4,4,1,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1549-8328,1558-0806,,IEEE T CIRCUITS-I,IEEE Trans.

However, downloading and analyzing raw or semi processed microarray data from GEO is not intuitive and requires manual error-prone analysis and a bioinformatics background. This is due to a lack of standardization in array platform fabrication as well as the lack of a simple interactive tool for clustering, plotting, differential expression testing, and testing for functional enrichment. Results: We introduce the Bioinformatics Array Research Tool (BART), an R Shiny web application that automates the microarray download and analysis process across diverse microarray platforms, it provides an intuitive interface, automatically downloads and parses data from GEO, suggests groupings of samples for differential expression testing, performs batch effect correction, outputs quality control plots, converts probe IDs, generates full lists of differentially expressed genes, and performs functional enrichment analysis. We show that BART enables a more comprehensive analysis of a wider range of microarray datasets on GEO by comparing it to four leading online microarray analysis tools. Conclusions: BART allows a scientist with no bioinformatics background to extract knowledge from their own microarray data or microarray experiments available from GEO. BART is functional on more microarray experiments and provides more comprehensive analyses than extant microarray analysis tools.

In order to explore intervention strategies, firstly a two-layered network was generated considering real conditions, and its diffusion threshold is calculated based on previous studies. Then, after dividing intervention conditions into before and after the outbreak, intervention strategies were explored from the aspects of network topology and public management. And the results indicated that before the outbreak, the superposition of networks will add to the difficulty in intervention, while an integrated immunization strategy which takes the topology of multiplex network into consideration works well. After the outbreak, the integrated immunization strategy has a relative worse effect. But releasing correct information could receive a better effect on intervention. Besides, releasing correct information in the online network has better effect on the final results than in the offline network. Also, correct information with high acceptance rate will weaken the influence of degree on intervention, which means that nodes with high or low degree have no significant difference in intervention effect.","[Zhu, Xiaoxia; Liu, Mengmeng] Yanshan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Qinhuangdao, Peoples R China; [Liu, Mengmeng] Dalian Univ Technol, Inst Syst Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China","Liu, MM (corresponding author), Yanshan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Qinhuangdao, Peoples R China.; Liu, MM (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Inst Syst Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China.",liummengdj@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71301140]; Hebei Natural Science Fund [G2015203425]; Program for Youth Talents by Department of Education in Hebei Province [BJ2017078]; Program for Talents of Third Level; Program for Youth Talents in Hebei Province,"The authors would like to thank the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71301140), Hebei Natural Science Fund (G2015203425) and the Program for Youth Talents by Department of Education in Hebei Province (BJ2017078).

Medical and security applications require very high fluxes and consequently a very fast shaper in order to limit dead time losses due to pile-up. However, if the shaper is faster than the collection of the charges in the semiconductor, there is a loss of charge called ballistic deficit. Moreover, variations of the electrical field profile in the detector over time causes a change in the collection time of the charges. According to this, the response of the detector will be affected by these variations. The instability of the response is visible over time as a channel shift of the spectra, resulting in a false information of the photon energy. The aim of this work is to develop real-time digital algorithms implementable in an FPGA in order to correct these effects and to give a stable response of the detector at very high fluxes. The method has been tested with a 4x4 pixels detector (CdTe) of 3 mm thickness and 800 mu m pitch which is able to measure transmitted X-ray spectra in the energy range of 20-160 kV on 256 energy bins. The detector is coupled with an innovative custom-designed digital readout electronics able to perform a fast digital signal processing for very high-fluxes measurements. The developed method was initially tested at low count rate with a Co-57 and Am-241 gamma-ray sources. After this first validation, it was tested with an X-ray beam, with a counting rate up to similar to 2.10(6) c/s. With the characterization and the validation of this innovative algorithm we prove its ability in providing a stable response of the detector over time without losing on the energy resolution (similar to 8% at 122 keV) and on the dead time (similar to 70 ns).","[de Cesare, C.; Brambilla, A.; Ouvrier-Buffet, P.; Stanchina, S.; Verger, L.] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CEA LETI, Minatec Campus, F-38054 Grenoble, France; [Rossetto, O.] Univ Grenoble Alpes, LPSC, CNRS IN2P3, 53 Ave Martyrs, F-38026 Grenoble, France","Brambilla, A (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, CEA LETI, Minatec Campus, F-38054 Grenoble, France.",andrea.brambilla@cea.fr,"rossetto, olivier/N-2175-2018","Andrea, BRAMBILLA/0000-0002-2400-1759",,,,25,0,0,0,8,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1748-0221,,,J INSTRUM,J.

Unlike devices with Pt and Au contacts, devices with TI do not exhibit the short-term (in the order of hundreds of hours) fluctuations in the spectroscopic response. Furthermore, these devices show a stable behavior and can work under much lower electric fields.

These beverages may be perceived as healthier options than soda. To educate consumers about beverages high in added sugar, several cities and states have proposed policies mandating health warning labels on sugar-sweetened beverages. Methods: In 2015, a total of 2,381 parents were randomized to a no label, calorie label, or warning label condition. An online survey asked about the healthfulness of different beverages, and asked parents to select a beverage for their child in a choice task. Regressions compared the warning and calorie label groups to the control group and measured mediating effects of health beliefs on beverage choice. Data were analyzed in 2016. Results: Parents viewed fruit drinks, sports drinks, and sweetened teas as healthier and less likely to cause disease than soda. Compared with no label, warning labels significantly increased parents' risk perceptions for all beverages except soda. Warning labels significantly reduced the odds of selecting fruit drinks for the child (OR=0.42, 95% CI=0.32, 0.56), and this effect was mediated by changes in health beliefs and risk perceptions. Conclusions: Fruit drinks, sports drinks, and sweetened teas are increasingly promoted to youth.

The split-CDAC architecture combines a V-cm-free technique in a floating CDAC scheme. The V-cm-free technique avoids a power hungry V-cm generator, and the floating CDAC scheme allows the conversion of a high-voltage input signal with low supply voltage and without a significant attenuation of the input signal. Moreover, a modified direct-switching SAR logic is adopted to improve the conversion speed. The prototype was fabricated in a 0.18 mu m 1P6M Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and achieves 86.16dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio and an Figure of Merit (FOM) of 0.41pJ/conversion-step.","[Guan, Rui; Xue, Jianfeng; Yang, Chao; Jin, Jing; Zhou, Jianjun] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China","Jin, J (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",jinjing@sjtu.edu.cn,"Zhou, Jianjun/AAC-6469-2020","Zhou, Jianjun/0000-0001-9898-7285","Chinese National Natural Science FoundationNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61376038, 61774103, 61404084]","This research was supported by Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (grant no. 61376038), Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (grant no. 61774103) and Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (grant no. 61404084).

Because people only interact with few other individuals, and the structure of these interactions influence spreading processes, the pairwise relationships between individuals can be usefully represented by a network. Although the underlying transmission processes are different, the network approach can be used to study the spread of pathogens in a contact network or the spread of rumours in a social network. We study simulated simple and complex epidemics on synthetic networks and on two empirical networks, a social/contact network in an Indian village and an online social network. Our goal is to learn simultaneously the spreading process parameters and the first infected node, given a fixed network structure and the observed state of nodes at several time points. Our inference scheme is based on approximate Bayesian computation, a likelihood-free inference technique. Our method is agnostic about the network topology and the spreading process. It generally performs well and, somewhat counter-intuitively, the inference problem appears to be easier on more heterogeneous network topologies, which enhances its future applicability to real-world settings where few networks have homogeneous topologies.","[Dutta, Ritabrata; Mira, Antonietta] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Computat Sci, Lugano, Switzerland; [Mira, Antonietta] Univ Insubria, Dept Sci & High Technol, Varese, Italy; [Onnela, Jukka-Pekka] Harvard Univ, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA","Dutta, R (corresponding author), Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Computat Sci, Lugano, Switzerland.",duttar@usi.ch,,,"Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [105218_163196]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R37AI051164, R37AI051164, R37AI051164, R37AI051164, R37AI051164, R37AI051164, R37AI051164, R37AI051164] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558, U54GM088558] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",The research was supported by Swiss National Science Foundation grant no. 105218_163196 (Statistical Inference on Large-Scale Mechanistic Network Models).,,58,5,5,0,7,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-5021,1471-2946,,P ROY SOC A-MATH PHY,Proc.

As vaccination coverage rates remain suboptimal in several developed countries, and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases become more prevalent, it is important that we build on previous research by analyzing themes in online vaccination discussions, including those that individuals may see without actively searching for information on immunization. Objective: The study aimed to explore the sentiments and themes behind an unsolicited debate on immunization in order to better inform public health interventions countering antivaccination sentiment. Methods: We analyzed and quantified 117 user-driven open-ended comments on immunization posted in the Comments section of a Facebook advertisement that targeted Canadian parents for recruitment into a larger study on immunization Then, 2 raters coded all comments using content analysis. Results: Of 117 comments, 85 were posted by unique commentators, with most being female (65/85, 77%). The largest proportion of the immunization comments were positive (51/117, 43.6%), followed by negative (41/117, 35.0%), ambiguous (20/117, 17.1%), and hesitant (5/117, 4.3%). Inaccurate knowledge (27/130, 20.8%) and misperceptions of risk (23/130, 17.7%) were most prevalent in the 130 nonpositive comments. Other claims included distrust of pharmaceutical companies or government agencies (18/130, 13.8%), distrust of the health care system or providers (15/130, 11.5%), past negative experiences with vaccination or beliefs (10/130, 7.7%), and attitudes about health and prevention (10/130, 7.7%). Almost 40% (29/74, 39%) of the positive comments communicated the risks of not vaccinating, followed by judgments on the knowledge level of nonvaccinators (13/74, 18%). A total of 10 positive comments (10/74, 14%) specifically refuted the link between autism and vaccination. Conclusions: The presence of more than 100 unsolicited user-driven comments on a platform not intended for discussion, nor providing any information on immunization, illustrates the strong sentiments associated with immunization and the arbitrariness of the online platforms used for immunization debates. Health authorities should be more proactive in finding mechanisms to refute misinformation and misperceptions that are propagating uncontested online. Online debates and communications on immunization need to be identified by continuous monitoring in order for health authorities to understand the current themes and trends, and to engage in the discussion.","[Tustin, Jordan Lee] Ryerson Univ, Sch Occupat & Publ Hlth, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada; [Tustin, Jordan Lee; Crowcroft, Natasha Sarah; Gesink, Dionne; Johnson, Ian] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Crowcroft, Natasha Sarah] Publ Hlth Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Crowcroft, Natasha Sarah] Univ Toronto, Lab Med & Pathobiol, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Keelan, Jennifer] Concordia Univ Edmonton, Dept Publ Hlth, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Lachapelle, Barbara] Toronto Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada","Tustin, JL (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Sch Occupat & Publ Hlth, 350 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.",jtustin@ryerson.ca,,"Crowcroft, Natasha/0000-0002-6761-8783","Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Public Health Ontario","The authors wish to thank Public Health Ontario and the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, for providing funding sources.",,49,6,6,0,1,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",2369-2960,,,JMIR PUBLIC HLTH SUR,JMIR Public Health Surveill.,JUL-SEP,2018,4,3,,,,,129,141,PMID 3020585,10.2196/10090,,,13,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",VJ0RP,WOS:000526815700012,30249585,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-18,

Analyses of phylogenetic markers, read mapping and single nucleotide polymorphisms served to correct the identification. We propose that the routine use of such analyses could help to detect misidentifications arising from unsupervised analyses and correct them before they enter the databases.

First, we critically discuss the most important definitions of the umbrella term fake news, in the so-called post-truth era, in order to emphasize different challenges in conceptualizing this elusive social phenomenon. Second, employing some valuable contribution from literature, we present and illustrate with vivid examples 10 categories of fake news. Each type of fake news is discussed in the context of organizational communication. Based on existent literature, we propose a 3D conceptual model of fake news, in an organizational context. Furthermore, we consider that PR managers can use either reactive PR strategies to counteract online fake news regarding an organization, or communication stratagems to temporarily transform the organization served into a potential source of fake news. The existing typology of reactive public relations strategies from the literature allow us to discuss the challenge of using them in counteracting online fake news. Each reactive PR strategy can be a potential solution to respond to different types of online fake news. Although these possibilities seem to be extensive, in some cases, PR managers can find them ineffective. In our view, this cluster of reactive PR strategies is not a panacea for managing fake news in the online environment and different strategic approaches may be need, such as communication stratagems. In this context, communication stratagems consist in using organization as a source or as a vector for strategic creation and dissemination of online fake news, for the benefit of the organization. We conclude that within online environment PR managers can employ a variety of reactive PR strategies to counteract fake news, or different communication stratagems to achieve organizational goals.","[Farte, Gheorge-Ilie; Obada, Daniel-Rares] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Philosophy & Sociopolit Sci, Dept Commun Sci & Publ Relat, Iasi, Romania","Farte, GI (corresponding author), Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Philosophy & Sociopolit Sci, Dept Commun Sci & Publ Relat, Iasi, Romania.",farte@uaic.ro; daniel.obada@uaic.ro,,"Obada, Daniel Rares/0000-0001-5699-6538",,,,27,0,0,1,14,LUMEN PUBLISHING HOUSE,IASI,"TEPES VODA, NO2, IASI, IASI, 00000, ROMANIA",2068-0236,2069-9387,,POSTMOD OPEN,Postmod.

A wide range of behaviours constitute academic dishonesty and while a complex phenomenon to examine, existing evidence suggests that there is sufficient proliferation (both in volume and variety) of these behaviours among Australian university students to warrant concern. This proliferation presents faculty and staff with new challenges in ensuring academic integrity. Objectives: This paper reports findings of a nationwide cross-sectional survey of 361 students enrolled in an Australian nursing degree program and describes the extent of academic dishonesty among those surveyed. Design: An online survey adapted from previous work was used to collect data on academic dishonesty, professional dishonesty and social desirability bias. Analysis of this data enabled identification of the prevalence of dishonesty, relationships between individual characteristics and dishonest behaviours, associations between academic and professional dishonesty, and the impact of deterrents to such behaviour. Results: Plagiarism was the most frequently reported form of academic misconduct. Most participants indicated that threat of severe punishment and signing of verification statements would deter undesirable academic behaviour. Despite this, a relatively high proportion of students reported engaging in at least one form of academic misconduct, the likelihood of which was higher among younger age groups. Of concern was that a correlation was found between academic and professional misconduct, the most common being the recording of inaccurate or fabricated vital signs and breaching client privacy. Conclusion: In health professional education, there is a tendency to assume that the nobility of these disciplines would result in a lower incidence of cheating behaviours. The findings of this study support existing literature that refutes this assumption. This study found troubling rates of academic and professional misconduct among the surveyed population.","[Birks, Melanie] James Cook Univ, Ctr Nursing & Midwifery Res, Coll Healthcare Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Smithson, John; Antney, Janene] James Cook Univ, Coll Healthcare Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Zhao, Lin] RMIT Univ, Sch Hlth & Biomed Sci, Bundoora, Vic, Australia; [Burkot, Camilla] James Cook Univ, Coll Healthcare Sci, Cairns, Qld, Australia","Birks, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Nursing & Midwifery Res, Coll Healthcare Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",melanie.birks@jcu.edu.au; John.smithson@jcu.edu.au; Janene.Antney@jcu.edu.au; Lin.zhao@rmit.edu.au,"Jia, Chuanchang/AAA-5513-2020",,,,,18,5,5,0,22,CHURCHILL LIVINGSTONE,EDINBURGH,"JOURNAL PRODUCTION DEPT, ROBERT STEVENSON HOUSE, 1-3 BAXTERS PLACE, LEITH WALK, EDINBURGH EH1 3AF, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0260-6917,1532-2793,,NURS EDUC TODAY,Nurse Educ.

We also tested whether the effects of those two message characteristics were moderated by prior beliefs about the health and climate impacts of red meat consumption. The data were collected with an online survey of the adult population living in Finland (N = 1279). We found that messages had a small but desired effect on intentions when the effect of prior beliefs was taken into account, but that that effect was strongly moderated by prior beliefs. In particular, messages changed behavioural intentions among the meat sceptics (i.e., those believing relatively strongly in the negative health and climate effects of meat consumption) but not among the meat believers (defined symmetrically). The combination of frames and refutation of misinformation were not found to be more effective strategies than the provision of information through single-framed, one-sided messages. We found limited evidence that the way a message was formulated determined its effectiveness in changing behaviours. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The most popular research task to counteract misinformation, Rumour detection, requires repeated signals to reach adequate detection accurate. Consequently, rumour detection recognizes rumours only when they have started spreading and causing harm. We introduce a new task called rumour prediction that assesses the possibility of a document arriving from a social media stream becoming a rumour in the future. Note that rumour prediction differentiates itself from rumour detection through instant decision making. This allows refuting misinformation before it spreads and causes harm. Our approach to rumour prediction harnesses content based features in combination with novelty based features and pseudo feedback. Our experiments show that we are able to accurately predict, whether a document will become a rumour in the future. Additionally, we show how rumour prediction can significantly improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art Rumour detection systems.","[Qin Yumeng; Tang Cunchen] Wuhan Univ, Int Sch Software, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wurzer, Dominik] Wuhan Univ, Sch Informat Management, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wurzer, Dominik] AI Machina Technol, A-1010 Vienna, Austria","Qin, YM (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Int Sch Software, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",yumeng.qin@whu.edu.cn; Dominik@Wurzer.com,,,,,,25,3,3,0,32,TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE LIMITED HONG KONG,BEIJING,"BLDG#13, PUHUINANLI, SOUTH YUYUANTAN RD, HAIDIAN DIST, BEIJING, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",1022-4653,2075-5597,,CHINESE J ELECTRON,Chin.

Although our study confirms that content from fake news websites is increasing, these sites do not exert excessive power. Instead, fake news has an intricately entwined relationship with online partisan media, both responding and setting its issue agenda. In 2016, partisan media appeared to be especially susceptible to the agendas of fake news, perhaps due to the election. Emerging news media are also responsive to the agendas of fake news, but to a lesser degree. Fake news coverage itself is diverging and becoming more autonomous topically. While fact-checkers are autonomous in their selection of issues to cover, they were not influential in determining the agenda of news media overall, and their influence appears to be declining, illustrating the difficulties fact-checkers face in disseminating their corrections.","[Vargo, Chris J.] Univ Colorado Boulder, Big Data & Analyt, Boulder, CO USA; [Guo, Lei; Amazeen, Michelle A.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA","Vargo, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Boulder, Coll Media Commun & Informat, 1511 Univ Ave, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",Christopher.vargo@colorado.edu,"Amazeen, Michelle A./I-7544-2019","Amazeen, Michelle A./0000-0003-0167-7323",,,,56,98,100,61,244,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,MAY,2018,20,5,,,,,2028,2049,,10.1177/1461444817712086,,,22,Communication,Communication,GF6SR,WOS:000432098300019,,,Y,N,2020-12-18,

The perpetrator's goal for the behavior is to meet personal emotional needs by forcing unnecessary or misguided medical or psychological treatment. Generally, a mother is the perpetrator and her child is the victim. There is a serious lack of research into most aspects of MCA, and this study is the first to utilize the anonymity of an Internet forum to investigate victims' first-hand experiences of, and the public's opinions about, suspected and confirmed MCA. Three-hundred and fifty-six posts by 348 members were explored and coded using formal qualitative content analysis. By accessing an open-thought online forum, this paper acquired information regarding social perceptions about the nonperpetrating partners who are unaware of the maltreatment; the disturbing and counterintuitive phenomenon of MCA itself; and the resistance often faced by those who attempt to report it.","[Anderson, Anoushka P.

More recently, DMFBs based on a micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed, and droplet manipulations on MEDA biochips have also been experimentally demonstrated. In order to ensure robust fluidic operations and high confidence in the outcome of biochemical experiments, MEDA biochips must be adequately tested before they can be used for bioassay execution. This paper presents the first approach for testing of MEDA biochips that include both CMOS circuits and microfluidic components. We first present structural test techniques to evaluate the pass/fail status of each microcell (droplet actuation, droplet maintenance, and droplet sensing) and identify faulty microcells. In order to ensure correct operation of functional units, e.g., mixers and diluters, we also present functional test techniques to address fundamental MEDA operations, such as droplet dispensing, transportation, mixing, and splitting. We evaluate the proposed test methods using simulations as well as experiments for fabricated MEDA biochips.","[Li, Zipeng; Chakrabarty, Krishnendu] Duke Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Lai, Kelvin Yi-Tse; Yu, Po-Hsien; Lee, Chen-Yi] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Hsinchu 30010, Taiwan; [Ho, Tsung-Yi] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan","Li, ZP (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Durham, NC 27705 USA.",zipeng.li@duke.edu; kelvin@si2lab.org; yph3135134@hotmail.com; krish@duke.edu; tyho@cs.nthu.edu.tw; cylee@si2lab.org,"Li, Zipeng/AAF-2402-2019","Ho, Tsung-Yi/0000-0001-7348-5625","Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 103-2221-E-009-191, 104-2218-E-009-007]; Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 105-2221-E-007-118-MY3, 104-2220-E-007-021]; Technische Universitat Munchen-Institute for Advanced Study; German Excellence Initiative; European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [291763]","The work of K.

Recent improvements in technology using Social Media (SM) has dramatically changed the way communication happens. Success stories of Facebook, Twitter, Linkedln, WhatsApp, blog sites are some examples of how different media are used by people to communicate using digital technology and social media. Access to information, including healthcare, using SM is on the rise owing to its ease and accessibility. Since people have the provision to share their views, experiences, voice opinions and share knowledge on different aspects of healthcare using social media, patients, caregivers and health professionals have started accessing health related information more frequently using SM. SM has inherent limitation to be misinterpreted, misinformed, mis-represented when not used properly. Patients are increasingly turning to internet and online sources for accessing health information. Poor quality of information, damage to professional image, breaches of patient privacy, violation of patient-healthcare professionl boundaries, licensing issues and legal issues are identified as challenges to the use of SM for health information by various researchers. Due to advances in technology it has become easy to access information using SM, which could be a double edged sword. This narrative review tries to highlight advantages and loopholes in using SM for accessing healthcare information. The objective of the current study is to understand use of SM for accessing healthcare based on empirical evidence drawn from studies carried out in both developed and developing countries. Studies show that correct, timely and authentic information related to various aspects of healthcare should to be shared through SM whereas incorrect and misleading health information on SM could be harmful, if not catastrophic. Governments and apex bodies involved in healthcare regulation shall have regulations as well as SM presence.","[Sasidharan, Asha; Janodia, Manthan Dilipkumar] Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal Coll Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharm Management, Manipal 576104, Karnataka, India","Janodia, MD (corresponding author), Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal Coll Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Pharm Management, Manipal 576104, Karnataka, India.",manthan.janodia@gmail.com,,,Indian Council of Social Science Research [02/295/2015-16/ICSSR/RP],We thank Indian Council of Social Science Research for sanctioning the project titled Use of Social Media for seeking Health Related Information: A Survey and Policy Perspective (F.No. 02/295/2015-16/ICSSR/RP Dated: 30-12-2015),,22,0,0,0,6,ASSOC PHARMACEUTICAL TEACHERS INDIA,BANGALORE,"AL-AMEEN COLL PHARMACY, OPP LALBACH MAIN GATE, HOSUR MAIN RD, BANGALORE, 560 027, INDIA",0019-5464,,,INDIAN J PHARM EDUC,Indian J.

However, there is a wide gap between this broad scientific consensus and public opinion. Internet blogs have strongly contributed to this consensus gap by fomenting misunderstandings of AGW causes and consequences. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) have become a poster species for AGW, making them a target of those denying AGW evidence. Here, focusing on Arctic sea ice and polar bears, we show that blogs that deny or downplay AGW disregard the overwhelming scientific evidence of Arctic sea-ice loss and polar bear vulnerability. By denying the impacts of AGW on polar bears, bloggers aim to cast doubt on other established ecological consequences of AGW, aggravating the consensus gap. To counter misinformation and reduce this gap, scientists should directly engage the public in the media and blogosphere.","[Harvey, Jeffrey A.] Netherlands Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Harvey, Jeffrey A.; Van den Berg, Daphne; Ellers, Jacintha] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Ecol Sci Anim Ecol, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Crowther, Thomas W.] Inst Ecol, Dept Terr Ecol Netherlands, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Crowther, Thomas W.] Inst Integrat Biol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Roessingh, Peter] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Biodivers & Ecosyst Dynam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Verheggen, Bart] Amsterdam Univ Coll, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nuijten, Rascha J.

This mixed-method study design used an interviewer-administered semi-structured interview with clinicians (n = 52) and a written self-administered survey with similar items completed by parents (n = 54). Items focused on experiences, opinions, and ideas about HPV vaccine utilization in the clinical setting, family, and patient perceptions about HPV vaccination and potential future efforts to increase vaccine utilization. Quantitative items were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while qualitative content was analyzed thematically. Suggested solutions for achieving higher rates of HPV vaccination noted by clinicians included public health education, the removal of stigma associated with vaccines, media endorsements, and targeting parents as the primary focus of educational messages. Parents expressed the need for more information about HPV-related disease, HPV vaccines, vaccine safety, sexual concerns, and countering misinformation on social media. Results from this mixed-method study affirm that educational campaigns targeting both health care professionals and parents represent a key facilitator for promoting HPV vaccination; disease burden

The data comprise similar to 126,000 stories tweeted by similar to 3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.","[Vosoughi, Soroush; Roy, Deb] MIT, Media Lab, E14-526,75 Amherst St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Aral, Sinan] MIT, E62-364,100 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA","Aral, S (corresponding author), MIT, E62-364,100 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",sinan@mit.edu,,"Vosoughi, Soroush/0000-0002-2564-8909",,,,34,791,800,88,462,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",0036-8075,1095-9203,,SCIENCE,Science,MAR 9,2018,359,6380,,,,,1146,+,,10.1126/science.aap9559,,,6,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,FY4ZM,WOS:000426835900044,29590045,Green Published,Y,N,2020-12-18,

Aiming at measuring the spatial distribution of radiation dose for mixed neutron-gamma fields, an advanced two-dimensional (2D) THGEM-TEPC was designed and constructed at McMaster University which will enable us to overcome the operational limitation of the classical TEPCs, particularly for high-dose rate fields. Compared to the traditional TEPCs, anode wire electrodes were replaced by a THGEM layer, which not only enhances the gas multiplication gain but also offers a flexible and convenient fabrication for building 2D detectors. Method & MaterialsThe 2D THGEM TEPC consists of an array of 3 x 3 sensitive volumes, equivalent to nine individual TEPCs, each of which has a dimension of 5 mm diameter and length. Taking the overall cost, size and flexibility into account, to process nine detector signals simultaneously, a multi-input digital pulse processing system was developed by using modern microcontrollers, each of which is coupled with a 12-bit sampling ADC. ResultsUsing the McMaster Tandetron Li-7(p,n) accelerator neutron source, both fundamental detector performance, as well as neutron dosimetric response of the 2D THGEM-TEPC, has been extensively investigated and compared to the data acquired by a standard spherical TEPC. It was shown that the microdosimetric response and the measured absorbed dose rate of the 2D THGEM detector developed in this study are comparable to the standard 1/2 TEPC which is commercially available. ConclusionThis study proved that the 2D TEPC based on the THGEM technology can be effectively used in microdosimetry studies and is a promising detector for measuring the absorbed dose rate distribution over an area in mixed radiation fields. This unique small gas cavity detector opens new possibilities in applications for high-intensity mixed radiation fields as well as in nanodosimetry.

Warning labels on cigarette packs might help correct these misperceptions. Methods: We carried out an online study with 1200 smokers (18-62 years old), randomized to 3 conditions: text warning labels, pictorial warning labels, and a control group (water bottle labels). Warning labels were based on those proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010. Participants in each condition saw 4 randomly selected labels and rated their expected longevity and chances of surviving to age 75 after exposure. Analyses of covariance controlled for cigarettes per day and self-rated health. Results: Compared to control, both text and pictorial warnings reduced participants' expected longevity (text: mean = 76.8 years, pictorial: 77.3, control 79.4) and their estimated chances of living to 75 (text: 62.0%, pictorial: 63.0%, control 66.5%). The contrast between text and pictorial labels combined and control showed significantly reduced expected longevity (p = .011) and chances of living to 75 (p = .004). Differences between text and pictorial conditions were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Large text or pictorial warnings on cigarette packs might help smokers develop a more accurate understanding of the effects of smoking on their longevity.","[Popova, Lucy; Thrul, Johannes] Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Tobacco Control Res & Educ, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Popova, Lucy] Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Thrul, Johannes] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA; [Glantz, Stanton A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, Ctr Tobacco Control Res & Educ, Philip R Lee Inst Hlth Policy Studies, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA","Popova, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Francisco, Ctr Tobacco Control Res & Educ, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.; Popova, L (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",lpopova1@gsu.edu,,,"National Cancer Institute and Food and Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products [P50CA180890, R00CA187460]; National Cancer InstituteUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [U01 CA154240]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, U01CA154240, U01CA154240, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, R00CA187460, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, U01CA154240, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, U01CA154240, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, U01CA154240, U01CA154240, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, R00CA187460, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, R00CA187460, U01CA154240, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890, P50CA180890] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER",The National Cancer Institute and Food and Drug Administration Center for Tobacco Products (P50CA180890 and R00CA187460) and the National Cancer Institute (U01 CA154240) supported this work.

The computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) has been applied on the digital complete denture which is developed rapidly. Tooth selection and arrangement is one of the most important parts in digital complete denture. In this paper, we propose a new method of personalized teeth arrangement. Methods: This paper presents a method of arranging teeth virtually for a complete denture. First, scan and extract the feature points of the 3D triangular mesh data of artificial teeth (PLY format), then establish a tooth selection system. Second, scan and mark the anatomic characteristics of the maxillary and mandibular cast surfaces, such as facial midline, the curve of the arches. With the enter information, the study calculates the common arrangement lines of artificial teeth. Third, select the preferred artificial teeth and automatically arrange them virtually in the correct position by using our own software. After that, design the gingival part of the dentures on the basic of the arranged teeth on the screen and then fabricated it by using Computerized Numerical Control (CNC)technology, Rapid Prototyping (RP) technology or 3D printer technology. Finally, select artificial teeth were embedded in wax rims. Results: This system can choose artificial teeth reasonably and the teeth placement can meet the dentist's request to a certain extent, whereas all the operations are based on the medical principles. Conclusions: The study performed here involves computer sciences, medicine, and dentistry, a teeth selection system was proposed and virtual teeth arrangement was described. This study has the capacity of helping operators to select teeth, which improved the accuracy of tooth arrangement, and customized complete denture. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Smoke emissions and exposure monitoring is critical for public and environmental health protection; however, ground-level measurements of smoke from wildfires and prescribed fires has proven difficult, as existing (validated) monitoring technologies are expensive, cumbersome, and generally require line power. Few ground-based measurements are made during fire events, which limits our ability to assess the environmental and human health impacts of wildland fire smoke. & para;& para;The objective of this work was to develop and validate an Outdoor Aerosol Sampler (OAS) - a filter-based air sampler that has been miniaturized, solar powered, and weatherproofed. This sampler was designed to overcome several of the technical challenges of wildland fire monitoring by being relatively inexpensive and solar powered. The sampler design objectives were achieved by leveraging low-cost electronic components, open-source programming platforms, and in house fabrication methods. A direct-reading PM2.5 sensor was selected and integrated with the OAS to provide time-resolved concentration data. Cellular communications established via short message service (SMS) technology were utilized in transmitting online sensor readings and controlling the sampling device remotely. A Monte Carlo simulation aided in the selection of battery and solar power necessary to independently power the OAS, while keeping cost and size to a minimum.& para;& para;Thirteen OAS were deployed to monitor smoke concentrations downwind from a large prescribed fire. Aerosol mass concentrations were interpolated across the monitoring network to depict smoke concentration gradients in the vicinity of the fire. Strong concentration gradients were observed (spatially and temporally) and likely present due to a combination of changing fire location and intensity, topographical features (e.g., mountain ridges), and diurnal weather patterns. Gravimetric filter measurements made by the OAS (when corrected for filter collection efficiency) showed relatively good agreement with measurements from an EPA federal equivalent monitor. However, the real-time optical sensor (Sharp GP2Y1023AU0F, Sharp Electronic Co.) within the OAS suffered from temperature dependence, drift, and imprecision.","[Kelleher, Scott; Miller-Lionberg, Daniel; Volckens, John] Colorado State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Quinn, Casey] Colorado State Univ, Dept Environm & Radiol Hlth Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Volckens, J (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",john.volckens@colostate.edu,,"Quinn, Casey/0000-0002-6802-5250; Volckens, John/0000-0002-7563-9525",Joint Fire Science Program [16-2-01-3],"The authors wish to thank the following individuals for their contributions to this work: Josh Smith for software and firmware development; Nick Good, John Mehaffy, and Christian L'Orange for assistance with field sampling and data analysis methods; John (Jay) Godson (USES), Sarah Gallup (CDPHE), Pat McGraw (CDPHE), and Ken Helcoski (CDPHE) for their coordination with field sampling.

Until now the performance of moldless lens fabrication process relied heavily on this step to precisely control the shape of each liquid droplet. Hence, a major hurdle in lenses fabricated from liquid droplets is the large variability of droplet shapes because they are sensitive to small amounts of interfacial forces. The shape of the final droplet critically affects the imaging performance of the lenses and cannot be reversed easily. Here, we aim to overcome this hurdle by performing in situ aberration correction using Fourier ptychography techniques. We demonstrate, for the first time, that computational optics can reverse high amounts of optical aberrations in moldless lenses and achieve high resolution imaging. In terms of imaging resolution, we successfully increased the resolving power of low powered moldless elastomer lenses by almost threefold, from a numerical aperture of 0.035 to 0.099. The computational approach directly elucidates the spatially varying wavefront aberrations from each lens using the same imaging system. This provides direct feedback of droplet lens fabrication techniques without the need for advanced wavefront correction methods. The application of computational imaging onto moldless lenses, using consumer digital imaging systems, lends itself to the global efforts in decentralising high resolution image intensive scientific tools to the wider community.

These ongoing enhancements permit increasingly detailed comparisons between the simulation outputs and real observational data. Recent projects such as Illustris are capable of producing simulated images that are designed to be comparable to those obtained from local surveys. This paper tests the degree to which Illustris achieves this goal across a diverse population of galaxies using visual morphologies derived from Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists. Morphological classifications provided by these volunteers for simulated galaxies are compared with similar data for a compatible sample of images drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Legacy Survey. This paper investigates how simple morphological characterization by human volunteers asked to distinguish smooth from featured systems differs between simulated and real galaxy images. Significant differences are identified, which are most likely due to the limited resolution of the simulation, but which could be revealing real differences in the dynamical evolution of populations of galaxies in the real and model universes. Specifically, for stellar masses M-star less than or similar to 10(11) M-circle dot, a substantially larger proportion of Illustris galaxies that exhibit disk-like morphology or visible substructure, relative to their SDSS counterparts. Toward higher masses, the visual morphologies for simulated and observed galaxies converge and exhibit similar distributions. The stellar mass threshold indicated by this divergent behavior confirms recent works using parametric measures of morphology from Illustris simulated images. When M-star less than or similar to 10(11) M-circle dot, the Illustris data set contains substantially fewer galaxies that classifiers regard as unambiguously featured. In combination, these results suggest that comparison between the detailed properties of observed and simulated galaxies, even when limited to reasonably massive systems, may be misleading.","[Dickinson, Hugh; Fortson, Lucy; Scarlata, Claudia; Willett, Kyle; Beck, Melanie; Galloway, Melanie] Univ Minnesota, Sch Phys & Astron, 116 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Lintott, Chris; Kruk, Sandor] Univ Oxford, Oxford Astrophys, Denys Wilkinson Bldg,Keble Rd, Oxford OX1 3RH, England; [Bamford, Steven] Univ Nottingham, Sch Phys & Astron, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Cardamone, Carolin] Wheelock Coll, Dept Math & Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Simmons, Brooke] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Phys, Ctr Astrophys & Space Sci, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Keel, William] Univ Alabama, Dept Phys & Astron, Box 870324, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Masters, Karen] Univ Portsmouth, Inst Cosmol & Gravitat, Dennis Sciama Bldg,Burnaby Rd, Portsmouth PO1 3FX, Hants, England; [Vogelsberger, Mark; Torrey, Paul] MIT, Dept Phys, Kavli Inst Astrophys & Space Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Snyder, Gregory F.] Space Telescope Sci Inst, 3700 San Martin Dr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA","Dickinson, H (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Sch Phys & Astron, 116 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,"Bamford, Steven/0000-0001-7821-7195; Simmons, Brooke/0000-0001-5882-3323; Masters, Karen/0000-0003-0846-9578","US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [AST1716602]; US National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [AST1716602]; STFCScience & Technology Facilities Council (STFC) [ST/N003179/1]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) through Einstein Postdoctoral Fellowship [PF5-160143]; NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NAS8-03060, NAS5-26555]; NASA through Hubble Fellowship - STScI [HST-HF2-51384.001-A]; Alfred P.

In fact, when an age brings to the foreground the tensions of truthfulness and falsehood correct information and fake news, reality and fiction, genuineness and delusion, this testifies to the unpredictability and inscrutable nature of the confusion into which public communication has been entrained. The rapid development of new media and digital technologies is causing a far-reaching process of change, especially in the field of politics. In his book on the post-truth era, Ralph J Keyes announced the advent of a 'fib-friendly times, in which more lies than ever are being told (Keyes 2004, 4). However, the considerations in this paper rest on a more cautious and critical approach. They support a viewpoint of pluriperspectivism. The new media have surely raised a challenge to contemporary communications. Political affairs are always about certain perspectives and contributions in the constant agon or contest of truth. There is no completely neutral and non-partisan claim to truth, as some philosophers and scientists aspired to represent. Because of its particular nature, the truth can be revealed only with controversy and effort, never without participation and beyond any perspectives. Nevertheless, neither does the truth decline nor do we enter an age of post-truth. Moreover, we can argue about the question which age tends more towards the lie and fake news. Politics is not in a more difficult state today than it has ever been, nor is it in a much simpler position in terms of truth. The truth remains for politics a supporting ground and a permanent benchmark for assessment.

Material and methods: For each of the 10 patients in need of one tooth-supported crown, five monolithic crowns were produced out of lithium disilicate reinforced glass ceramic. Four different optical impression and associated computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/ CAM) systems were used for crown fabrication (digital workflows): (1) Lava C.O.S. scanner and Lava C.O.S. and CARES CAD software, centralized CAM (group L); (2) Cadent iTero scanner, CARES CAD software and centralized CAM (group iT); (3) Cerec Bluecam, Cerec Connect CAD software, followed by laboratory-based CAM (group CiL); and (4) centralized CAM (group CiD). The conventional crown (group K) was fabricated based on a conventional silicone impression followed by a conventional wax-up and heat press technique. The examiners were blinded and evaluated the crowns clinically at the bisque-bake stage (initial try-in), and subsequently after finalization by a dental technician (final try-in). For the assessment of crown quality, modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria were used. Treatment times were recorded for clinical evaluation and adjustment. The quality ratings were analyzed descriptively. For both the continuous and ordinal outcomes, the non-parametric paired Wilcoxon test was applied, together with an appropriate Bonferroni correction to evaluate the differences between treatment groups. The results of the statistical analysis were interpreted globally at the significance level P = 0.05. Results: The clinical evaluation during the initial and final try-ins demonstrated similar clinical outcome measures for crowns generated with the four digital workflows and the conventional workflow. No statistically significant differences of crown quality in any state were found between groups (P > 0.005). The total clinical treatment times measured were: 456 +/- 240 s for L; 655 +/- 374 s for iT; 783 +/- 403 s for CiL; 556 +/- 285 s for CiD; and 833 +/- 451 s for K. No statistically significant differences in treatment times were found between the groups (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Within the limitations of the present study, the monolithic ceramic crowns resulting from the four different CAD/CAM systems did not differ from the conventionally produced crowns with respect to the clinical quality rating and the treatment time efficiency.","[Muhlemann, S.; Benic, G.

This low rate may be related to the unsatisfactory knowledge of vaccination, influenza, and misperception of health risks in the general population. To examine these issues, we used an online questionnaire consisting of 12 closed questions. The basic knowledge on influenza and vaccination was examined. The questionnaire was completed by 1669 persons, mostly young women. Generally, 73% of respondents passed the threshold of 70% correct answers, but important gaps in their knowledge were identified concerning the persons at risk of developing the infection (7.9% of correct answers) and the timing of vaccination (8.4% of correct answers). Although most respondents did identify the etiologic agent correctly (91.1% knew influenza is caused by a virus), only 12.3% knew that the vaccines registered in Poland contain fragments of viruses or its antigens, while 63.1% thought the vaccines contain live bacteria. In conclusion, the knowledge on influenza vaccination is deficient in the general population. Education on immunization should be prioritized to increase vaccination coverage rate in Poland.","[Kuchar, Ernest] Warsaw Med Univ, Clin Assessment Unit, Dept Pediat, Warsaw, Poland; [Ludwikowska, Kamila; Szenborn, Leszek] Wroclaw Med Univ, Dept Pediat Infect Dis, Wroclaw, Poland; [Antczak, Adam] Med Univ Lodz, Dept Gen & Oncol Pulmonol, Lodz, Poland; [Mastalerz-Migas, Agnieszka] Wroclaw Med Univ, Dept Family Med, Wroclaw, Poland; [Nitsch-Osuch, Aneta] Warsaw Med Univ, Dept Social Med & Publ Hlth, Warsaw, Poland","Ludwikowska, K (corresponding author), Wroclaw Med Univ, Dept Pediat Infect Dis, Wroclaw, Poland.",kama.ludwikowska@gmail.com,"Kuchar, Ernest/U-1869-2019; Kuchar, Ernest P./D-6761-2015; Mastalerz-Migas, Agnieszka/W-5453-2018","Kuchar, Ernest P./0000-0002-7883-2427; Ludwikowska, Kamila M./0000-0002-4128-3401; NITSCH-OSUCH, ANETA/0000-0002-2622-7348; Mastalerz-Migas, Agnieszka/0000-0001-6600-2760",,,,20,4,4,2,4,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0065-2598,2214-8019,978-3-030-01635-7; 978-3-030-01634-0,ADV EXP MED BIOL,Adv.Exp.Med.Biol.,,2018,1108,,,,,,55,61,,10.1007/5584_2018_233,10.1007/978-3-030-01635-7,,7,"Biology; Immunology; Medicine, Research & Experimental; Respiratory System",Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Immunology; Research & Experimental Medicine; Respiratory System,BL8IW,WOS:000456452400006,29995213,,,,2020-12-18,

A commonly identified motive among students who engage in NPS is to improve grades. Several research studies have observed that NPS most likely does not confer an academic advantage, and is associated with excessive drinking and other drug use. This study documents the proportion of the general college student population who believe that NPS will lead to improvements in academic performance. Methods: This study gathered online survey data from a large, demographically diverse sample of college students to document the prevalence of perceived academic benefit of NPS for improving grades and to examine the association between such belief and NPS. Results: Overall, 28.6% agreed or strongly agreed that NPS could help students earn higher grades, and an additional 38.0% were unsure. Students with a higher level of perceived academic benefit of NPS and more frequent patterns of drinking and marijuana use were more likely to engage in NPS, even after adjustment for a wide range of covariates. Conclusions: The results underscore the need for interventions that simultaneously correct misperceptions related to academic benefit and target alcohol and marijuana use to reduce NPS.","[Arria, Amelia M.; Caldeira, Kimberly M.; Barrall, Angelica L.; Vincent, Kathryn B.] Univ Maryland, Ctr Young Adult Hlth & Dev, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Behav & Community Hlth, 1234 Sch Publ Hlth Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Geisner, Irene M.; Kilmer, Jason R.; Fossos-Wong, Nicole; Yeh, Jih-Cheng; Rhew, Isaac; Lee, Christine M.; Larimer, Mary E.] Univ Washington, Ctr Study Hlth & Risk Behav, 1100 NE 45th St,Suite 300, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Cimini, M.

More evidence is needed to understand the popularity of health-related rumors and how Health Educators can optimize their use of SNSs. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the spread of health rumors and verified information on SNSs using the Zika virus as a case study. Methods: A content analysis of Zika-related news stories on SNSs between February 2016 and January 2017 was conducted to verify accuracy (phase 1). Phase 1 was followed by an analysis of volume of shares (phase 2) and a thematic analysis of headlines (phase 3). Results: Rumors had three times more shares than verified stories. Popular rumors portray Zika as a conspiracy against the public and a low-risk issue and connect it to the use of pesticides. Discussion: This study identifies the value of integrating in-depth analysis of popular health-related rumors into the development of communication strategies. Translation to Health Education Practice: Misinformation on SNSs can hinder disease prevention efforts. This study shows how information circulating on SNSs can be analyzed from a quantitative and qualitative standpoint to help Health Educators maximize the use of online communication platforms.,"[Sommariva, Silvia; Vamos, Cheryl; Dao, Lillie Uyen-Loan; Tyson, Dinorah Martinez] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Mantzarlis, Alexios] Poynter Inst Media Studies, St Petersburg, FL USA","Sommariva, S (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Coll Publ Hlth, Dept Community & Family Hlth, 13201 Bruce B Downs Blvd, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.",sommarivas@health.usf.edu,"Ahmed, Mohamed/AAG-9664-2019",,,,,60,24,24,11,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1932-5037,2168-3751,,AM J HEALTH EDUC,Am.

To investigate this possibility, an experiment was conducted exposing users to a simulated Facebook News Feed featuring misinformation and different correction mechanisms (one in which news stories featuring correct information were produced by an algorithm and another where the corrective news stories were posted by other Facebook users) about the Zika virus, a current global health threat. Results show that algorithmic and social corrections are equally effective in limiting misperceptions, and correction occurs for both high and low conspiracy belief individuals. Recommendations for social media campaigns to correct global health misinformation, including encouraging users to refute false or misleading health information, and providing them appropriate sources to accompany their refutation, are discussed.","[Bode, Leticia] Georgetown Univ, Commun Culture & Technol Program, 3520 Prospect St NW Suite 311, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Vraga, Emily K.] George Mason Univ, Dept Commun, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA","Bode, L (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Commun Culture & Technol Program, 3520 Prospect St NW Suite 311, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",lb871@georgetown.edu,"Vraga, Emily/K-9325-2019","Vraga, Emily/0000-0002-3016-3869",,,,56,62,63,19,76,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1041-0236,1532-7027,,HEALTH COMMUN,Health Commun.,,2018,33,9,,,,,1131,1140,,10.1080/10410236.2017.1331312,,,10,Communication; Health Policy & Services,Communication; Health Care Sciences & Services,GI5WT,WOS:000434442000009,28622038,,Y,N,2020-12-18,

Car owners sometimes publish false information to protect their privacy or interests. The spread of these false messages will contribute to potential loss as rumors. Recently, the emergence of the vehicular social network has further accelerated the spread of rumors and anti-rumors. Researchers have proposed a number of methods to reduce the loss caused by rumors. However, these methods do not account for the fact that it takes some time for users to reply to the message after receiving the rumors. Each user responds differently to rumors, but previous methods do use fixed conversion rates in different states. To overcome these difficulties, individuals are classified as susceptible, trustful, contagious, immune or recoverable (STCIR). We propose a novel STCIR model to study the dynamic propagation of rumors. Each user is assigned a time threshold attribute to indicate the time delay of the user's response. In some cases, a user may receive a rumor repeatedly in the course of the time threshold. Furthermore, we introduce vehicular nodes as authorities that produce correct information to curb rumors through user forwarding, and the anti-rumors starting from users are regarded as a rumor cascade. The experimental results reveal that vehicular nodes can reduce the scale and number of rumors. Vehicular nodes emerge early and move fast, and by moving to a greater degree, these nodes can increase the efficiency of mitigating rumors.","[Wu, Youke] Huaqiao Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Quanzhou 362021, Peoples R China; [Huang, Haiyang; Zhao, Junjie; Wang, Cheng; Wang, Tian] Huaqiao Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China","Wang, T (corresponding author), Huaqiao Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China.",cs_tianwang@163.com,"Wang, Tian/AAA-2492-2020","Wang, Tian/0000-0003-4819-621X","Huaqiao University Academic Project through the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [17SKGC-QG05]; Project of Humanities and Social Sciences through the Research on the Mechanism of Investigation and Early Warning of Mass Events in the Context of New Media, Ministry of Education in China [18YJC870020]","This work was supported in part by the Huaqiao University Academic Project through the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 17SKGC-QG05 and in part by the Project of Humanities and Social Sciences through the Research on the Mechanism of Investigation and Early Warning of Mass Events in the Context of New Media, Ministry of Education in China, under Grant 18YJC870020.",,39,7,8,1,11,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2018,6,,,,,,62612,62621,,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2876394,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,HA7KL,WOS:000450459900001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020-12-18,

Communities deal with anxiety and make sense of the unknowable by mixing apprehensions with what is already known to them. With modernity, and in line with studies on a range of social phenomena, there have been efforts to develop a science on rumour. Most of these studies deal with rumour at the propositional level, such that the rumouring or rumour-rebutting subject invariably belongs to one of the two sides of the 'true-false' divide. Similar categories are followed in the study of rumour in social media, where the nodes in a rumour chain are, however, less hierarchical, and where images are increasingly used for persuasion. This paper, following a value-oriented approach, argues that the science on rumour has objectivized the problem, and has suggested instrumental solutions like enhancing the digital literacy of social media users. Whereas a value position should ideally attempt to efface the dilemma of the rumouring/rumour-rebutting subject, and locate rumours within the larger socio-political and historical context of a society.","[Aricat, Rajiv] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Social Sci, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore","Aricat, R (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Social Sci, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",raricat@ntu.edu.sg,"Aricat, Rajiv G/O-7002-2015","Aricat, Rajiv G/0000-0001-9709-344X",,,,22,2,2,2,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INDIA  PVT LTD,NEW DELHI,"B-1-I-1 MOHAN CO-OPERATIVE INDUSTRIAL AREA, MATHURA RD, POST BAG NO 7, NEW DELHI 110 044, INDIA",0971-6858,0973-0737,,J HUM VALUES,J.

We document the history of StopFake, describe its work practices, and situate them within the literatures on fact checking and online news practices. Our study of its work practices shows that StopFake employs the online media monitoring characteristic of modern journalism, but rather than imitating new stories it applies media literacy techniques to screen out fake news and inhibit its spread. StopFake evaluates news stories for signs of falsified evidence, such as manipulated or misrepresented images and quotes, whereas traditional fact-checking sites evaluate nuanced political claims but assume the accuracy of reporting. Drawing on work from science studies, we argue that attention of this kind to social processes demonstrates that scholars can acknowledge that narratives are socially constructed without having to treat all narratives as interchangeable.","[Haigh, Maria; Kozak, Nadine I.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Informat Studies, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Haigh, Maria; Haigh, Thomas] Siegen Univ, Sch Informat & Media, Siegen, Germany; [Haigh, Thomas] Univ Wisconsin, Hist Dept, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA","Haigh, M (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Sch Informat Studies, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.; Haigh, M (corresponding author), Siegen Univ, Sch Informat & Media, Siegen, Germany.",mhaigh@uwm.edu; thomas.haigh@gmail.com; kozakn@uwm.edu,,,University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Information Studies,"We would like to thank our informants within StopFake, the anonymous reviewers, Lucas Graves for his comments on an earlier version of this article, Christine Evans for her insights into Soviet media, and Dean Tomas Lipinski for support given to this research by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Information Studies.",,87,22,23,4,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

We critically evaluated YouTube videos about Zika virus available during the recent Zika pandemic. Methods: Hundred-and-one videos were retrieved from YouTube (search term: zika virus). Based upon content, they were classified as: informative, misleading or personal experience videos. Quality and reliability of these videos were evaluated using standardized tools. The viewer interaction metrics (e.g. no. of views, shares, etc.), video characteristics (video length, etc.) and the sources of upload were also assessed; and their relationship with the type, quality and reliability of the videos analyzed. Results: Overall, 70.3% videos were informative, while 23.8% and 5.9% videos were misleading and related to personal experiences, respectively. Although with shorter lengths (P < 0.01) and superior quality (P < 0.01), yet informative videos were viewed (P = 0.054), liked (P < 0.01) and shared (P < 0.05) less often than their misleading counterparts. Videos from independent users were more likely to be misleading (adjusted OR = 6.48, 95% CI: 1.69 - 24.83), of poorer (P < 0.05) quality and reliability than government/news agency videos. Conclusion: A considerable chunk of the videos were misleading. They were more popular (than informative videos) and could potentially spread misinformation. Videos from trust-worthy sources like university/health organizations were scarce. Curation/authentication of health information in online video platforms (like YouTube) is necessary. We discuss means to harness them as useful source of information and highlight measures to curb dissemination of misinformation during public health emergencies.","[Bora, Kaustubh] ICMR Reg Med Res Ctr, Dibrugarh 786010, Assam, India; [Das, Dulmoni] Indira Gandhi Natl Open Univ, Reg Study Ctr, Dept Psychol, Shillong, Meghalaya, India; [Das, Dulmoni] Army Inst Nursing, Dept Mental Hlth Nursing, Gauhati, Assam, India; [Barman, Bhupen] NEIGRIHMS, Dept Gen Med, Shillong, Meghalaya, India; [Borah, Probodh] Coll Vet Sci, BIF, Gauhati, Assam, India; [Borah, Probodh] Coll Vet Sci, Adv State Biotech Hub, Gauhati, Assam, India; [Borah, Probodh] Coll Vet Sci, Dept Anim Biotechnol, Gauhati, Assam, India","Bora, K (corresponding author), ICMR Reg Med Res Ctr, Dibrugarh 786010, Assam, India.",kaustubhbora1@gmail.com,,"Das, Dulmoni/0000-0001-6103-996X; Bora, Kaustubh/0000-0001-8426-8693",,,,48,14,14,10,39,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2047-7724,2047-7732,,PATHOG GLOB HEALTH,Pathog.

Research is needed to explore risk perceptions of developing smoking-related disease among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Data came from 267 HIV-positive smokers who completed an online survey assessing perceived health risks associated with (a) generic smoking status; (b) generic non-smoking status; (c) their own personal current smoking; and (d) a hypothetical situation in which they were a non-smoker. PLWH perceived greater risk associated with their current smoking versus hypothetical personal non-smoking (p's<0.001), and greater risks associated with generic smoking status compared with their current smoking (p's<0.001). Being on HIV medication (=0.65, 95% CI=0.17, 1.12), interest in quitting smoking (=0.89, 95% CI=0.45, 1.32), and having an HIV healthcare provider who has recommended cessation (=1.04, 95% CI=0.42, 1.67) were positively associated with perceived risk of developing smoking-related diseases. Findings have implications for developing targeted interventions to correct misperceptions regarding the health risks of smoking among PLWH, a population at particular risk for smoking and smoking-related morbidity and mortality.","[Pacek, Lauren R.; McClernon, F.

In doing so, it problematizes current social science scholarship, which emphasizes the analysis of digital data and analytics, and reinforces the magnitude of its consequences and 'data power'. The paper proposes making three corrective 'movements' that might enrich our approaches to how databases and analytics are assembled in business settings. The first movement involves the problem of ethnographic access to data-making practices. We propose taking seriously the issue of fabricating an ethnographic encounter where the process of making digital objects is exposed. The second movement concerns the visibility and the type of politics taking place in data practices. We argue for the need to displace attention from data impacts and results to the myriad of mundane practices and devices through which these objects are assembled. The third movement we suggest requires a focus on examining error and failure as key aspects of the manufacturing of consumer databases. Each of these movements is illustrated by ethnographic vignettes from a 9-month ethnographic experiment that involved participating in the first stages of the manufacturing of an online financial retail company's consumer database.","[Ariztia, Tomas] Univ Diego Portales, Sociol Dept, Santiago, Chile","Ariztia, T (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Hist, Ejercito 333, Santiago, Chile.",tomas.ariztia@udp.cl,,"Ariztia, Tomas/0000-0001-5806-3328",Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [1140078],This work was supported by Fondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico [Grant Number 1140078].,,49,3,4,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The dominant online platforms, however, have recently adopted speech policies and processes that depart from the U.S. model. In an agreement with the European Commission, the dominant tech companies have pledged to respond to reports of hate speech within twenty-four hours, a hasty process that may trade valuable expression for speedy results. Plans have been announced for an industry database that will allow the same companies to share hashed images of banned extremist content for review and removal elsewhere. These changes are less the result of voluntary market choices than of a bowing to governmental pressure. Companies' policies about extremist content have been altered to stave off threatened European regulation. Far more than illegal hate speech or violent terrorist imagery is in EU lawmakers' sights, so too is online radicalization and fake news. Newsworthy content and political criticism may end up being removed along with terrorist beheading videos, kill lists of U.S. servicemen, and instructions on how to bomb houses of worship. The impact of extralegal coercion will be far reaching. Unlike national laws that are limited by geographic borders, terms-of-service agreements apply to platforms' services on a global scale. Whereas local courts can order platforms only to block material viewed in their jurisdictions, a blacklist database raises the risk of global censorship. Companies should counter the serious potential for censorship creep with definitional clarity, robust accountability, detailed transparency, and ombudsman oversight.","[Citron, Danielle Keats] Univ Maryland, Law, Francis King Carey Sch Law, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Citron, Danielle Keats] Stanford Ctr Internet & Soc, Yale Informat Soc Pro, Stanford, CA 92612 USA","Citron, DK (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Law, Francis King Carey Sch Law, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.; Citron, DK (corresponding author), Stanford Ctr Internet & Soc, Yale Informat Soc Pro, Stanford, CA 92612 USA.",,,,,,,145,18,18,0,10,NOTRE DAME LAW SCHOOL,NOTRE DAME,"NOTRE DAME LAW SCHOOL, ROOM B1, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0745-3515,,,NOTRE DAME LAW REV,Notre Dame Law Rev.,,2018,93,3,,,,,1035,1071,,,,,37,Law,Government & Law,GJ9SF,WOS:000435744100003,,,,,2020-12-18,

Methods: Participants were e-mailed an online survey that queried campaign readership, perception of peer alcohol use, alcohol consumption, frequency of consumption, and frequency of blackouts. Associations between variables were evaluated using path analysis. Results: We found that campaign readership was associated with more accurate perceptions of peer alcohol use, which, in turn, was associated with self-reported lower number of drinks per sitting and experiencing fewer blackouts.

We argue that this understanding of NPS is fundamentally problematic. Differences within the category are obscured, as are similarities between NPS and more established categories of drugs. Focusing on NPS as something new, different or particularly special is misleading and counterproductive and can have serious consequences in terms of understanding the bigger picture in relation to illegal drugs more generally. This has led to overestimations of the size of the NPS problem, obfuscation of the common underlying causes of dependent drug use and the implementation of significant and problematic policy changes. Furthermore, a failure to see the rise in NPS as just one of a number of emerging trends in contemporary drug scenes, alongside the development of online markets or the rise in domestic drug production operations, for example, impairs our ability to understand the wider societal, cultural and theoretical underpinnings of drug use. NPS are not particularly special: treating them as such can have dangerous and far-reaching consequences.","[Potter, Gary R.] Univ Lancaster, Law Sch, Lancaster LA1 4YN, England; [Chatwin, Caroline] Univ Kent, Sch Social Policy Sociol & Social Res, Canterbury, Kent, England","Potter, GR (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Law Sch, Lancaster LA1 4YN, England.",g.potter2@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Potter, Gary/0000-0002-9942-0501",Economic and Social Research CouncilEconomic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/M002330/1] Funding Source: researchfish,,,68,11,10,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0968-7637,1465-3370,,DRUG-EDUC PREV POLIC,Drug-Educ.

We analyzed the weekly and daily trend of the relevant posts. Content analyses were applied to categorize the posts into 4 types with unified sorting criteria. The posts' characteristics and geographic locations were also analyzed in each category. We conducted further analysis on the top 5 most popular misleading posts. Results: A total of 1680 original microblog posts on the topic were retrieved and 341 (20.30%) of these posts were categorized as misleading messages. The number of relevant posts had not increased much during the first 2 weeks but rose to a high level in the next 2 weeks after the sudden increase in number of reported cases at the beginning of week 3. The posts under misleading messages occurred and increased from the beginning of week 3, but their daily posting number decreased when the daily number of posts under refuting messages outnumbered them. The microbloggers of the misleading posts had the lowest mean rank of followers and previous posts, but their posts had a highest mean rank of posts. The proportion of misleading messages in places with no reported cases was significantly higher than that in the epidemic areas (23.6% vs 13.8%). The popular misleading posts appeared to be short and consisted of personal narratives, which were easily disseminated on social media. Conclusions: Our findings suggested the importance of responding to common questions and misconceptions on social media platforms from the beginning of disease outbreaks. Authorities need to release clear and reliable information related to the popular topics early on. The microbloggers posting correct information should be empowered and their posts could be promoted to clarify false information. Equal importance should be attached to clarify misinformation in both the outbreak and nonoutbreak areas.","[Chen, Bin; Liu, Kui; Cai, Gaofeng; Jiang, Zhenggang; Gu, Hua; Jiang, Jianmin] Zhejiang Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, 3399 Binsheng Rd, Hangzhou 310051, Peoples R China; [Shao, Jian] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Huang, Yuru] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD USA","Jiang, JM (corresponding author), Zhejiang Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, 3399 Binsheng Rd, Hangzhou 310051, Peoples R China.",jmjiang@cdc.zj.cn,,"Chen, Bin/0000-0002-3761-0465",Nation-Zhejiang Cooperating Project [WKJ-2J-1001]; Zhejiang Major Science and Technology Project [2015C1027]; Zhejiang Provincial Research Institute of Public Health; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61572425],"This study was supported by research fund from Nation-Zhejiang Cooperating Project (WKJ-2J-1001), Zhejiang Major Science and Technology Project (2015C1027), Zhejiang Provincial Research Institute of Public Health (PI: Health Communication and Network Monitoring), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (61572425).

However, the role of the internet in IPED markets, and in particular the ways in which these substances are supplied via the surface web, has rarely been considered. This article examines the online IPED market in order to inform drug policy and to provide a nuanced understanding of retailers involved, particularly exploring the relationship between buyers and sellers. Methods: This paper is based on two extensive research projects conducted in the Netherlands and Belgium. The first project focuses on muscle drugs and is based on 64 IPED dealing cases, semi-structured interviews with authorities (N=32), and dealers (N=15), along with an analysis of 10 steroid-selling websites. The second research project primarily focuses on weight loss drugs and sexual enhancers in the Netherlands, and relies on interviews with authorities (N=38), suppliers (N=30), and consumers (N=10), analysis of 69 criminal case files, and an online analysis. Results: In the literature, the illicit online sale of IPEDs is generally associated with illegal online pharmacies that try to mislead buyers. While confirmed in our research, we also illustrate that there are online suppliers who invest in customer relationships and services, and that users are aware of the illegal nature of their business. These e-vendors incorporate a 'social supply business model' by providing the best possible service to their customers and attempting to minimise risks in order to attract, satisfy and maintain customers. Conclusion: As it is likely that users will continue to make use of the Internet to order IPEDs, regardless of closing down selling websites, it is first of all important to counteract these online sources by educating all types of consumers and providing harm reduction services.

This work represents the first demonstration of a large-area, flexible, paper-based graphene-molybdenum disulfide (Gr/MoS2) broadband photodetector using a low-cost solution-processed hydrothermal method and enhancement in photodetection through strain modulation by assembling the device on polydimethylsiloxane. Optimization, in terms of process parameters, was carried out to obtain trilayer MoS2 over Gr-cellulose paper. Under strain, potential barrier variation and piezopotential induced in MoS2 leads to 79.41% enhancement in photodetection in the visible region. Piezopotential induced in MoS2 lowers the conduction-band energy thereby increasing the effective electric field favoring easy electron-hole separation. The advantage of vertically stacked Gr/MoS2 for the photodetector is the utilization of the entire area as a junction where effective separation of electron-hole pairs occurs. Detailed studies of the mechanism in terms of potential barrier variation in Gr/MoS2 and an energy-band diagram are presented to help understand the proposed phenomenon. The present work demonstrates the significance of few-layer MoS2 or Gr in relation to strain-modulated photosensing in comparison to their counterparts grown via chemical vapor deposition. The results provide an excellent approach for the fabrication of low-cost heterojunctions for improved optoelectronic performance, which can be further extended to similar 2D-material heterojunctions for analog, digital and optoelectronic applications.","[Sahatiya, Parikshit; Badhulika, Sushmee] Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Dept Elect Engn, Hyderabad 502285, Andhra Prades, India","Badhulika, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Hyderabad, Dept Elect Engn, Hyderabad 502285, Andhra Prades, India.",sbadh@iith.ac.in,"badhulika, sushmee/AAG-1759-2019; Badhulika, Sushmee/AAQ-7179-2020","Badhulika, Sushmee/0000-0003-3237-3031; IIT Hyderabad, EE Department/0000-0002-5880-4023","DEITy; MCIT, Government of IndiaMinistry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY), Government of India; Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), IndiaDefence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) [ERIP/ER/RIC/2015-6/10/M/01/1660]","PS would like to thank Junior Research Fellows S Solomon Jones and P Thanga Gomathi for their assistance in hydrothermal synthesis.

The topic has also found increased attention online. But unlike scientific discourse, a majority of online discussion focuses on the so-called chemtrails conspiracy theory, the widely debunked idea that airplanes are spraying a toxic mix of chemicals through contrails, with supposed goals ranging from weather to mind control. This paper presents the results of a nationally representative 1000-subject poll part of the 36,000-subject 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), and an analysis of the universe of social media mentions of geoengineering. The former shows - 10% of Americans declaring the chemtrails conspiracy as completely and a further - 20-30% as somewhat true, with no apparent difference by party affiliation or strength of partisanship. Conspiratorial views have accounted for - 60% of geoengineering discourse on social media over the past decade. Of that, Twitter has accounted for > 90%, compared to - 75% of total geoengineering mentions. Further affinity analysis reveals a broad online community of conspiracy. Anonymity of social media appears to help its spread, so does the general ease of spreading unverified or outright false information.

We fabricate thin and uniform electrospun polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) nanofibers with a diameter of 170 +/- 80 nm, containing up to 254 +/- 9 mg mL(-1) of non-agglomerated UCNPs. On distributing these nanofibers in a microfluidic channel a 50-fold increase in luminescence over dispersed particles can be obtained. A versatile miniaturized platform is created to work with small sample volumes by transferring the upconversion nanofibers into microfluidic channels. Fast and reproducible analytical signal response to their environment is demonstrated by taking advantage of the isotope effect between H2O and D2O upon 980 nm excitation. Furthermore, relevance to analytical applications employing energy transfer was confirmed using the spectral overlap of the green UCNP emission with the absorption spectra of a dye. At minute optical path lengths (e.g. 50 mu m) the luminescence properties of the UCNPs help in avoiding the most disturbing light scattering effects of the excitation source and channel geometries. This new nanomaterial platform enables rapid, simple and reliable online monitoring in microfluidic systems, medical applications (e.g. in-tissue, in vivo) and anti-counterfeiting in contrast to solution-based UCNP applications.","[Buchner, Markus; Schenck, Milena; Fenzl, Christoph; Wongkaew, Nongnoot; Matlock-Colangelo, Lauren; Hirsch, Thomas; Duerkop, Axel; Baeumner, Antje J.] Univ Regensburg, Inst Analyt Chem Chemo & Biosensors, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany; [Ngoensawat, Umphan] King Mongkuts Univ Technol Thonburi, Sch Bioresources & Technol, Bangkok 10140, Thailand","Baeumner, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Regensburg, Inst Analyt Chem Chemo & Biosensors, D-93040 Regensburg, Germany.",antje.baeumner@ur.de,"Hirsch, Thomas/A-7601-2010; Duerkop, Axel/L-3990-2017; Baeumner, Antje/I-8870-2016","Hirsch, Thomas/0000-0002-4224-4762; Duerkop, Axel/0000-0003-3007-6471; Baeumner, Antje/0000-0001-7148-3423",Royal Golden Jubilee PhD program of the Thailand Research FundThailand Research Fund (TRF),The authors thank Joachim Rewitzer and Vanessa Tomanek for their assistance during ICP-OES measurements.

The results show a chemical-reaction controlled fiber/matrix interface in the as-fabricated composite, leading to pretty strong interfacial shear strength (similar to 537 MPa), measured by the fiber push-in tests. Interfacial engineering by chemical vapor deposited pyrocarbon interphase can effectively hinder the interfacial reactions and weaken the interfacial interactions. The low shear strength of the tailored fiber/matrix interface (similar to 155 MPa) could trigger the toughening mechanisms like interface debonding, fiber pull-out, etc., when the composite was subjected to external bending stresses. Finally, the fracture toughness of the novel composite was found significantly enhanced from similar to 0.8MPa root m to similar to 8.3MPa root m, after the interfacial engineering with pyrocarbon interphase.

Based on the FGTTs and FETs, a tribotronic negated AND (NAND) gate that achieves mechanical-electrical coupled inputs, logic operations, and electrical level outputs is fabricated. By further integrating tribotronic NAND gates with traditional digital circuits, several basic units such as the tribotronic S-R trigger, D trigger, and T trigger have been demonstrated. Additionally, tribotronic sequential logic circuits such as registers and counters have also been integrated to enable external contact triggered storage and computation. In contrast to the conventional sequential logic units controlled by electrical signals, contact-triggered tribotronic sequential logic circuits are able to realize direct interaction and integration with the external environment.

This content can impact preparedness and response due to the popularity and real-time nature of social media platforms. We sought to explore how the image-sharing platform Instagram is used for information dissemination and conversation during the current Zika outbreak. Study design: This was a retrospective review of publicly posted images about Zika on Instagram. Methods: Using the keyword '#zika' we identified 500 images posted on Instagram from May to August 2016. Images were coded by three reviewers and contextual information was collected for each image about sentiment, image type, content, audience, geography, reliability, and engagement. Results: Of 500 images tagged with #zika, 342 (68%) contained content actually related to Zika. Of the 342 Zika-specific images, 299 were coded as 'health' and 193 were coded 'public interest'. Some images had multiple 'health' and 'public interest' codes. Health images tagged with #zika were primarily related to transmission (43%, 129/299) and prevention (48%, 145/299). Transmission-related posts were more often mosquito-human transmission (73%, 94/129) than human human transmission (27%, 35/129). Mosquito bite prevention posts outnumbered safe sex prevention; (84%, 122/145) and (16%, 23/145) respectively. Images with a target audience were primarily aimed at women (95%, 36/38). Many posts (60%, 61/101) included misleading, incomplete, or unclear information about the virus. Additionally, many images expressed fear and negative sentiment, (79/156, 51%). Conclusion: Instagram can be used to characterize public sentiment and highlight areas of focus for public health, such as correcting misleading or incomplete information or expanding messages to reach diverse audiences.

The medical field is susceptible to propagation of misinformation, with poor differentiation between authenticated and erroneous information. Due to the presence of social bubbles, surgeons may not be aware of the misinformation that patients are reading, and thus, it may be difficult to counteract the false information that is seen by the general public.

We studied the media messages put forth by different stakeholders in two Ebola vaccine trials that became controversial in Ghana. These interactions between health authorities, political actors, and public citizens can offer key lessons for future research. Through an analysis of online media, we analyse stakeholder concerns and incentives, and the phases of the dispute, to understand how the dispute evolved to the point of the trials being suspended, and analyse what steps might have been taken to avert this outcome. Methods: A web-based system was developed to download and analyse news reports relevant to Ebola vaccine trials. This included monitoring major online newspapers in each country with planned clinical trials, including Ghana. All news articles were downloaded, selecting out those containing variants of the words Ebola, and vaccine, which were analysed thematically by a team of three coders. Two types of themes were defined: critiques of the trials and rebuttals in favour of the trials. After reconciling differences between coders' results, the data were visualised and reviewed to describe and interpret the debate. Results: A total of 27,460 articles, published between 1 May and 30 July 2015, were collected from nine different newspapers in Ghana, of which 139 articles contained the keywords and met the inclusion criteria. The final codebook included 27 themes, comprising 16 critiques and 11 rebuttals. After coding and reconciliation, the main critiques (and their associated rebuttals) were selected for in-depth analysis, including statements about the trials being secret (mentioned in 21% of articles), claims that the vaccine trials would cause an Ebola outbreak in Ghana (33%), and the alleged impropriety of the incentives offered to participants (35%). Discussion: Perceptions that the trials were secret arose from a combination of premature news reporting and the fact that the trials were prohibited from conducting any publicity before being approved at the time that the story came out, which created an impression of secrecy. Fears about Ebola being spread in Ghana appeared in two forms, the first alleging that scientists would intentionally infect Ghanaians with Ebola in order to test the vaccine, and the second suggesting that the vaccine might give trial participants Ebola as a side-effect - over the course of the debate, the latter became the more prominent of the two variants. The incentives were sometimes criticised for being coercively large, but were much more often criticised for being too small, which may have been related to a misperception that the incentives were meant as compensation for the trials' risks, which were themselves exaggerated. Conclusion: The rumours captured through this research indicate the variety of strong emotions drawn out by the trials, highlighting the importance of understanding the emotional and social context of such research. The uncertainty, fear, and distrust associated with the trials draw from the contemporary context of the Ebola outbreak, as well as longstanding historical issues in Ghana. By analysing the debate from its inception, we can see how the controversy unfolded, and identify points of concern that can inform health communication, suggesting that this tool may be valuable in future epidemics and crises.","[Kummervold, Per Egil; Fernandez-Luque, Luis] Norut Northern Res Inst, POB 6434,Tromso Sci Pk, N-9294 Tromso, Norway; [Schulz, William S.; Smout, Elizabeth; Larson, Heidi J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London, England; [Fernandez-Luque, Luis] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Qatar Comp Res Inst, Doha, Qatar","Kummervold, PE (corresponding author), Norut Northern Res Inst, POB 6434,Tromso Sci Pk, N-9294 Tromso, Norway.",per.egil.kummervold@norut.no,,,"Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking under EBODAC [115,847]; European UnionEuropean Union (EU); European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA)","The project has received funding from the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking under the grant agreement EBODAC (grant nr. 115,847).

Moreover, extended counting methods that make use of leftover charge (residue) on the integration capacitor help to improve the noise performance of these pixels. However, focal plane arrays with small pixel pitch are constrained in terms of pixel area, which makes it difficult to benefit from in-pixel extended counting circuitry. Thus, in this brief the authors propose a novel approach to measure the residue outside the pixel using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). A first prototype of the proposed pixel, in the form of a testbed, has been developed. It is aimed at medium-wave infrared imaging arrays that have a small pixel pitch. The prototype is composed of a pixel front end, a 12-bit successive approximation register ADC, a counter, and a comparator. The front end is a modified version of the conventional design and has been designed and fabricated in 90-nm CMOS, whereas off-the-shelf discrete components have been used to implement the ADC, comparator, and counter.

In this work, we developed models for automated verification of rumors (unverified information) that propagate through Twitter. To predict the veracity of rumors, we identified salient features of rumors by examining three aspects of information spread: linguistic style used to express rumors, characteristics of people involved in propagating information, and network propagation dynamics. The predicted veracity of a time series of these features extracted from a rumor (a collection of tweets) is generated using Hidden Markov Models. The verification algorithm was trained and tested on 209 rumors representing 938,806 tweets collected from real-world events, including the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, the 2014 Ferguson unrest, and the 2014 Ebola epidemic, and many other rumors about various real-world events reported on popular websites that document public rumors. The algorithm was able to correctly predict the veracity of 75% of the rumors faster than any other public source, including journalists and law enforcement officials. The ability to track rumors and predict their outcomes may have practical applications for news consumers, financial markets, journalists, and emergency services, and more generally to help minimize the impact of false information on Twitter.","[Vosoughi, Soroush; Mohsenvand, Mostafa 'Neo'; Roy, Deb] MIT, Lab Social Machines, 75 Amherst St,E14-526B, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Vosoughi, S (corresponding author), MIT, Lab Social Machines, 75 Amherst St,E14-526B, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",soroush@mit.edu; mmv@mit.edu; dkroy@media.mit.edu,,,,,,73,34,34,10,81,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA",1556-4681,1556-472X,,ACM T KNOWL DISCOV D,ACM Trans.

However, in such a disintermediated environment misinformation is pervasive and attempts to debunk are often undertaken to contrast this trend. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of debunking on Facebook through a quantitative analysis of 54 million users over a time span of five years (Jan 2010, Dec 2014). In particular, we compare how users usually consuming proven (scientific) and unsubstantiated (conspiracy-like) information on Facebook US interact with specific debunking posts. Our findings confirm the existence of echo chambers where users interact primarily with either conspiracy-like or scientific pages. However, both groups interact similarly with the information within their echo chamber. Then, we measure how users from both echo chambers interacted with 50,220 debunking posts accounting for both users consumption patterns and the sentiment expressed in their comments. Sentiment analysis reveals a dominant negativity in the comments to debunking posts. Furthermore, such posts remain mainly confined to the scientific echo chamber. Only few conspiracy users engage with corrections and their liking and commenting rates on conspiracy posts increases after the interaction.","[Zollo, Fabiana] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Venice, Italy; [Zollo, Fabiana; Del Vicario, Michela; Scala, Antonio; Caldarelli, Guido; Quattrociocchi, Walter] IMT Sch Adv Studies, Lucca, Italy; [Bessi, Alessandro] IUSS, Pavia, Italy; [Scala, Antonio] CNR, ISC, Rome, Italy; [Shekhtman, Louis; Havlin, Shlomo] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel","Zollo, F (corresponding author), Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Venice, Italy.; Zollo, F (corresponding author), IMT Sch Adv Studies, Lucca, Italy.",fabiana.zollo@unive.it,"Havlin, Shlomo/ABF-1527-2020; Zollo, Fabiana/Z-1506-2019; Scala, Antonio/H-9153-2019; Caldarelli, Guido/A-5274-2010; Quattrociocchi, Walter/L-4550-2016","Zollo, Fabiana/0000-0002-0833-5388; Scala, Antonio/0000-0002-3414-2686; Caldarelli, Guido/0000-0001-9377-3616; Quattrociocchi, Walter/0000-0002-4374-9324","EU FET project MULTIPLEX [317532]; SIMPOL [610704]; DOLFINS [640772]; SOBIGDATA [654024]; IMT/eXtrapola Srl [P0082]; Israel Ministry of Science and TechnologyMinistry of Science, Technology and Space (MOST), Israel; Japan Science and Technology AgencyJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International CooperationMinistry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (Italy); Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation; ONROffice of Naval Research; DTRAUnited States Department of DefenseDefense Threat Reduction Agency","Funding for this work was provided by EU FET project MULTIPLEX nr. 317532, SIMPOL nr. 610704, DOLFINS nr. 640772, SOBIGDATA 654024, IMT/eXtrapola Srl (P0082).

Since the transverse mechanical scanning in the common PIE is replaced by the on/off switching of the micromirrors, the data acquisition time can be reduced from more than 15 minutes to less than 20 seconds for recording 12 x 10 diffraction patterns to cover the same field of 147.08 mm(2). Furthermore, since the precision of DMD fabricated with the optical lithography is always higher than 10 nm (1 mu m for the mechanical translation stage), the time consuming positionerror-correction procedure is not required in the iterative reconstruction. These two improvements fundamentally speed up both the data acquisition and the reconstruction procedures in PIE, and relax its requirements on the stability of the imaging system, therefore remarkably improve its applicability for many practices. It is demonstrated experimentally with both USAF resolution target and biological sample that, the spatial resolution of 5.52 mu m and the field of view of 147.08 mm(2) can be reached with the DMD based PIE method. In a word, by using the DMD to replace the translation stage, we can effectively overcome the main shortcomings of common PIE related to the mechanical scanning, while keeping its advantages on both the high resolution and large field of view.

To address the high power consumption issue in high speed digital counters, a passing window (PW)-based hybrid counter topology is proposed. In this approach, the memory cells in the digital counters of SS-ADCs are disconnected from the global bus during non-relevant timing. To address the high column fixed pattern noise (FPN) under bright illumination conditions, a double auto-zeroing (AZ) scheme is proposed. In this technique, the AZ process is employed twice at reset and signal level, respectively. The double AZ scheme not only allows the comparator to serve as a crossing detector around the common-mode level, but it also enables low-voltage comparator design. The proposed techniques are experimentally verified in a prototype chip designed and fabricated in the TSMC 40 nm low-power CMOS process. The PW technique saves 52.8% of power consumption in the hybrid digital counters. Dark/bright column FPN of 0.0024%/0.028% is achieved employing the proposed double AZ technique for digital correlated double sampling.

This mixed methods study aims to understand patterns in seeking and sharing online health information for LBQ women attempting conception. Design: researchers performed a qualitative content analysis of 400 discussions in lesbian-oriented Facebook groups, containing 1764 total instances of text. 400 discussions from heterosexual-oriented conception and parenting Facebook groups were examined for comparison purposes, though they will not be the focus of this analysis. This paper also presents descriptive statistics on posts observed. Setting: posts were drawn from a representative sample of lesbian-oriented conception, pregnancy, and parenting Facebook groups. Posts examined for comparison purposes were drawn from groups that appeared to primarily serve heterosexual women. Measurements and findings: many participants in lesbian-oriented Facebook groups sought and provided medical information. Their queries focused on the insemination process, and frequently related to posters' specific situations, while heterosexual women tended to seek general advice about the conception and pregnancy process. The accuracy of the content of responses varied, and group members seemed to view the prevalence of contradictory information as positive evidence of diverse perspectives. Even when information was technically correct, posters did not always apply it properly to the question at hand. Key conclusions: barriers to maternity care, or a lack of education and initiative among primary care providers, may drive lesbian, bisexual, and queer women to seek health information from peers on the Internet when trying to become pregnant. These exchanges may contribute to misinformation, which may negatively affect lesbian, bisexual, and queer women's fertility outcomes and overall health. Implications for practice: clinicians should be conscious of online health information seeking as both a symptom of and cause of sexuality-based disparities.","[Ruppel, Emily H.] Smith Coll, Northampton, MA 01063 USA; [Merryman, Mallory] Smith Coll, Known Donor Project, Northampton, MA 01063 USA; [Karpman, Hannah E.] Smith Coll, Sch Social Work, Social Work, Northampton, MA 01063 USA; [Delk, Carolyn E.] Baystate Med Ctr, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, 759 Chestnut St, Springfield, MA 01199 USA","Ruppel, EH (corresponding author), Smith Coll, Northampton, MA 01063 USA.",eruppel@smith.edu; hkarpman@smith.edu; carolyn.delk@baystatehealth.org; mmerryma@smith.edu,"Ahmed, Mohamed/AAG-9664-2019",,,,,26,9,9,2,26,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0266-6138,1532-3099,,MIDWIFERY,Midwifery,MAY,2017,48,,,,,,18,23,,10.1016/j.midw.2017.02.011,,,6,Nursing,Nursing,ES4FF,WOS:000399485200003,28314179,,,,2020-12-18,

However, their behavior on SNS may influence public perceptions about their professionalism. Objective: This study explored how pharmacists separate professional and personal information and activities on SNS, their perceptions of professional behavior on SNS, and opinions on guidelines in this area. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with international practising pharmacists (n = 31) recruited from a range of countries (n = 9). Initially, pharmacists known to the research team were invited, and thereafter, participants were recruited using a snowballing technique. The interviews lasted from 30 to 120 min. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed. Results: A majority of participants mixed professional and personal information and activities on SNS, and about one third adopted a separation strategy where professional information and activities were clearly separated from personal ones (e.g. two different SNS accounts, or one particular SNS for professional use and another platform for personal purposes). Most participants expressed concern over how pharmacists present themselves and behave in SNS when they reported (un)professional behaviors of peers they had observed. Examples of perceived unprofessional behaviors included revealing details of personal life and activities; open complaints about the pharmacy sector, co-workers, physicians, and patients; inappropriate description of pharmacists' roles and activities; and breaches of patient confidentiality. Positive professional behaviors, such as expression of compassion for patients, examples of effective patient management, promotion of pharmacists' role, and correction of misleading health information being spread online were also observed. There was no consensus on having professional social media guidelines. Some preferred SNS to be unregulated while most believed certain guidance was needed to maintain high professional standards in the online environment. Conclusions: A definitive strategy to separate professional and personal information and activities on SNS was not adopted by most pharmacists. E-professionalism issues could negatively impact on the standing of individual practitioners and the profession. Most agreed that education about SNS use would be beneficial; however, support for guidelines or regulations for pharmacists' use of SNS was not unanimous. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It is termed CAMEO Copying Answers using Multiple Existence Online. A person using CAMEO sets up one or more harvesting accounts for collecting correct answers; these are then submitted in the user's master account for credit. The study has three main goals: Determining the prevalence of CAMEO, studying its detailed characteristics, and inferring the motivation(s) for using it. For the physics course that we studied, about 10% of the certificate earners used this method to obtain more than 1% of their correct answers, and more than 3% of the certificate earners used it to obtain the majority (> 50%) of their correct answers. We discuss two of the likely consequences of CAMEO: jeopardizing the value of MOOC certificates as academic credentials, and generating misleading conclusions in educational research. Based on our study, we suggest methods for reducing CAMEO. Although this study was conducted on a MOOC, CAMEO can be used in any learning environment that enables students to have multiple accounts.

In addition to inherent touch detection, physiological and environmental sensor interfaces are incorporated. The reconfigurable feature is effectively implemented by proposing two basis readout topologies of amplifier-based and oscillator-based circuits. For noise-immune design against various noises from inherent human-touch operations, an alternate-sampling error-correction scheme is proposed and integrated inside the ROIC, achieving a 12-bit resolution of successive approximation register (SAR) of analog-to-digital conversion without additional calibrations. A ROIC prototype that includes the whole proposed functions and data converters was fabricated in a 0.18 mu m complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, and its feasibility was experimentally verified to support multiple heterogeneous sensing functions of touch, electrocardiogram, body impedance, and environmental sensors.","[Park, Kyeonghwan; Kim, Seung Mok; Eom, Won-Jin; Kim, Jae Joon] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea","Kim, JJ (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.",khpark@unist.ac.kr; nailmong@unist.ac.kr; avella@unist.ac.kr; jaejoon@unist.ac.kr,"Kim, Jae Joon/F-8620-2011","Kim, Jae Joon/0000-0003-4581-4115","Technology Innovation Program - Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, South Korea [10064058]; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea - Ministry of Education [2016R1D1A1B03930404]","This work was supported by the Technology Innovation Program (10064058: Development of patch-type 7 modal multi-sensor devices and platform technology for wearable healthcare applications) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, South Korea and also supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Education under Grant 2016R1D1A1B03930404.",,27,6,6,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1424-8220,,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,APR,2017,17,4,,,,,,,759,10.3390/s17040759,,,13,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,EU1YU,WOS:000400822900100,28368355,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-18,

In particular, it should be able (1) to maximize the discovery of association rules amongst data items and (2) to handle the rapid growing data scale. The FP-Growth algorithm is a salient association rule learning method in exploring potential relation in database possibly with a lack of priori knowledge. It has the merits of low time & space complexity, whereas it cannot handle negative association rules which is necessary in comprehensive mining of health data. In order to enable comprehensive discovery of association rules, this study extends the FP-Growth algorithm to mine both positive and negative frequent patterns, namely the PNFP-Growth framework. The extended approach also adopts a prune strategy to filter out misleading patterns to the most by correlating the negative data items and the positive ones. Experiments had been performed to evaluate the performance of the PNFP-Growth over a public data set and a database consisting of thousands of people's real health examination information (collected within 5 years from the date of this publication). The results indicate that (1) the PNFP-Growth can excavate more patterns than the traditional counterpart does while it is still highly efficient, and (2) the analysis upon the health examination data is informative and well complies with the clinical practices, e.g., more than 30 % people suffering from hypertension are having high systolic pressure and liver problems.","[Wang, Bowei; Chen, Dan; Zhang, Jindong; Duan, Yifu; Hu, Ruimin] Wuhan Univ, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Shi, Benyun] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jingying] Cent China Normal Univ, Wuhan, Peoples R China","Chen, D (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Wuhan, Peoples R China.; Shi, BY (corresponding author), Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",dan.chen@ieee.org; benyunshi@outlook.com,,"Shi, Benyun/0000-0003-2734-3794","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61272314, 81402760]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2042015kf1009, 211410100028, CCNU16A02020]; Science & Technology Supporting Program in Hubei province [2015BAA113]; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education [14YJAZH005]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20161563]","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 61272314, 81402760), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Nos. 2042015kf1009, 211410100028 (WHU), CCNU16A02020(CCNU)), Science & Technology Supporting Program in Hubei province (No. 2015BAA113), Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education (No. 14YJAZH005), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (No. BK20161563).",,32,6,9,1,48,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1383-469X,1572-8153,,MOBILE NETW APPL,Mobile Netw.

Objective This study investigated the role social media play in pharmacy practice, particularly in patient care and how pharmacists interact online with patients and laypeople. Setting Face-to-face, telephone, or Skype interviews with practising pharmacists (n = 31) from nine countries. Method In-depth semi-structured interviews; audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed. Main outcome measure Two themes related to the use of social media for patient care: social media and pharmacy practice, and pharmacists' online interactions with customers and the public. Results Most participants were community pharmacists. They did not provide individualized services to consumers via social media, despite most of them working in a pharmacy with a Facebook page. No participant friended consumers on Facebook as it was perceived to blur the boundary between professional and personal relationships. However, they occasionally provided advice and general health information on social media to friends and followers, and more commonly corrected misleading health information spread on Facebook. Short YouTube videos were used to support patient counselling in community pharmacy. Conclusions Participants recognized the potential social media has for health. However, its use to support patient care and deliver pharmacy services was very incipient. Pharmacists as medicine experts are well equipped to contribute to improvements in social media medicines-related information, learn from consumers' online activities, and design new ways of delivering care to communities and individuals.","[Benetoli, Arcelio; Chen, Timothy F.; Chaar, Betty; Aslani, Parisa] Univ Sydney, Fac Pharm, Pharm & Bank Bldg A15, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Benetoli, Arcelio] Univ Estadual Ponta Grossa, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, BR-84030900 Ponta Grossa, Parana, Brazil; [Schaefer, Marion] Charite, Invalidenstr 115, D-10115 Berlin, Germany","Aslani, P (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Pharm, Pharm & Bank Bldg A15, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",parisa.aslani@sydney.edu.au,"Chen, Timothy/X-3684-2019","Aslani, Parisa/0000-0002-7976-8236; Chen, Timothy/0000-0003-4189-8403",International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP); Brazilian Government/National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq),"We wish to thank all participants who provided their time, valuable experiences and opinions, as well as the assistance of Ms Tara Hehir.

Hardware Trojan (HT) is a malicious, unauthenticated and undesired modification to an integrated circuit (IC), which is a major part of electronics. The modification may leak important information, causing the system to fail while operating in real time. HT has been found as a problem to military, medical, transportation and other critical systems. It is a major security threat for the integrated circuit like FPGA, ASIC, Microcontroller, microprocessor. Hence it is a major security challenge to prevent and detect the hardware Trojan. In this regard first we have to know the ways in which this HT can be encountered. The most significant way to handle this Trojan problem is to understand the Trojan classification and counter attack techniques.

The present randomized controlled trial was designed to prevent increased and problematic alcohol use abroad by correcting misperceptions of peer drinking norms abroad and by promoting positive and healthy adjustment into the host culture (i.e., sojourner adjustment) through brief online personalized feedback interventions. A sample of 343 study abroad college students was randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions including a personalized normative feedback intervention (PNF), a sojourner adjustment feedback intervention (SAF), a combined PNF + SAF intervention, and an assessment-only control condition. Generalized estimated equation analyses accounting for baseline drinking and consequences revealed an intervention effect for PNF that was mitigated by baseline drinking level, such that PNF was best for those with lighter baseline drinking, but heavier baseline drinkers receiving PNF alone or PNF + SAF drank comparatively similar or more heavily abroad to those in the control condition. However, PNF + SAF condition participants with greater baseline levels of consequences reported comparatively less consequences abroad than their control participants. Thus, PNF alone may be helpful for lighter drinkers at predeparture and the addition of SAF to PNF may help prevent consequences abroad for those reporting more consequences prior to departure abroad. This research represents an important first step in designing and implementing efficacious interventions with at-risk study abroad college students, for which no current empirically based programs exist.","[Pedersen, Eric R.] RAND Corp, 1776 Main St,POB 2138, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA; [Neighbors, Clayton] Univ Houston, Houston, TX 77004 USA; [Atkins, David C.; Lee, Christine M.; Larimer, Mary E.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA","Pedersen, ER (corresponding author), RAND Corp, 1776 Main St,POB 2138, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA.",ericp@rand.org,,"Atkins, David/0000-0002-5781-9880","National Research Service from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [1F31AA018591]; University of Washington Alcohol and Drug Abuse InstituteUniversity of Washington; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA) [F31AA018591, F31AA018591] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This research was supported by a National Research Service Award (1F31AA018591) awarded to Eric R.

When that happens, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can request that companies distribute corrective advertisements to address misinformation and inaccurate claims. Previous research has demonstrated effectiveness in corrective advertising for various products. Objectives: The present article builds on that work with a randomized experimental study (n = 6454) of corrective advertising investigating the extent to which visual similarity matters between violative and corrective ads and the extent to which time delay matters between violative and corrective advertisement exposure. Methods: Our study sample included overweight or obese U.S. adults recruited from an existing online consumer panel representative of the U.S. adult population. We created a brand for a fictitious prescription weight-loss drug and produced corresponding direct-to-consumer (DTC) television ads. All participants viewed the same violative ad, but were randomly assigned to view corrective ads with different levels of visual similarity and exposure time delay using a 4 x 4 between-subjects factorial design. Results: Results suggest corrective ad exposure can influence consumer perceptions of drug efficacy, risks, and benefits previously established by violative ads that overstated drug efficacy, broadened drug indication, and omitted important risk information. Corrective ads also can weaken consumer intentions to consider and investigate a drug. However, ad similarity does not appear to affect consumer perceptions and preferences. Although we found that the effects of violative ad exposure tend to diminish over time, the length of the delay between violative and corrective ad exposure has limited influence. An exception to this was observed with regard to recall of drug benefits and risks, where the impact of corrective ad exposure increases with greater time delay. Conclusions: These results extend previous research to a new health condition and hold implications for regulatory policy.

Specifically, micropillar splitting test was firstly employed to measure in-situ the localized fracture toughness. The results revealed that the carbon interphase can effectively hinder the interfacial reactions between Nextel (TM) 440 fiber and SiC matrix, thus remarkably weakening the composite interfacial shear strength from similar to 293 MPa to similar to 42 MPa, and enhance the composite fracture toughness from similar to 1.8 MPa root m to similar to 6.3 MPa root m, respectively. This is mainly a consequence of weak interface that triggers crack deflection at the fiber/interphase interface.

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is increasingly used for topographic surveys due to the ability to acquire high resolution data over spatially-extensive areas. This capability is ideally suited to saltmarsh environments, which are often vast, inaccessible systems where topographic variations can be very subtle. Derivation of surface (DSMs) (ground elevation plus vegetation) versus terrain (bare ground elevation) models (DTMs) relies on the ability of the LiDAR sensor to accurately record multiple returns. In saltmarshes however, the dense stands of low (< 1 m) vegetation commonly found precludes the acquisition of more than one return, and the resulting DTM is not different to the DSM. Establishing the offset between ground and vegetation surface in order to correct the LiDAR-derived DTM can be challenging due to the spatial variability in saltmarsh habitats. Here we show the development and application of a habitat-specific correction factor (HSCF) for the Odiel Saltmarshes using a combination of habitat object-based classification (82% overall accuracy) and ground control surveys that reduces the DTM error to within that associated with the LiDAR sensor (average error 0.1 m). We also show that the true accuracy of supplied (unmodified) DTMs can be > 0.5 m in saltmarshes dominated by dense vegetation such as Spartina densiflora. In particular, global projections of sea-level rise across the next 80 years (0.18-0.59 m) significantly overlaps this accuracy margin, implying that assessments and modelling of sea-level impacts in saltmarsh systems will likely be erroneous if based on Lidar-derived DTMs. Erroneous assumptions and conclusions can result if the real accuracy of DTMs (bare ground) on vegetated saltmarshes is not considered, and the consequences of the propagation of this misinformation through to management decisions should not be over-looked.","[Fernandez-Nunez, M.; Burningham, H.] UCL, Geog Dept, Pearson Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6B, England; [Fernandez-Nunez, M.; Ojeda Zujar, J.] Univ Seville, Dept Geog Fis, Calle Maria de Padilla Sn, Seville 41004, Spain; [Fernandez-Nunez, M.; Ojeda Zujar, J.] Univ Seville, AGR, Calle Maria de Padilla Sn, Seville 41004, Spain","Fernandez-Nunez, M (corresponding author), UCL, Geog Dept, Pearson Bldg,Gower St, London WC1E 6B, England.; Fernandez-Nunez, M (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Geog Fis, Calle Maria de Padilla Sn, Seville 41004, Spain.; Fernandez-Nunez, M (corresponding author), Univ Seville, AGR, Calle Maria de Padilla Sn, Seville 41004, Spain.",miriam.nunez.10@ucl.ac.uk,"Fernandez-Nunez, Miriam/AAC-4055-2020; Ojeda-Zujar, Jose/K-1885-2014","Fernandez-Nunez, Miriam/0000-0001-6072-1414; Ojeda-Zujar, Jose/0000-0002-4672-064X; Burningham, Helene/0000-0002-2897-2608","Spanish National Research Plan; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (Detail mapping and web dissemination of demographic, tourist and environmental data for vulnerability assessments linked to beach erosion in the Andalusia Coast (sea-level rise associated to climate change) [CSO2010-15807]; Andalusia regional government (Espacializacion y Difusion Web de Datos de Urbanizacion, y Fitodiversidad para el Analisis de Vulnerabilidad ante los Procesos de Inundacion Asociados a la Subida del Nivel del Mar en la Costa Andaluz) [RNM-6207]","The current study has been developed within two research projects: one funded by the Spanish National Research Plan and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (Detail mapping and web dissemination of demographic, tourist and environmental data for vulnerability assessments linked to beach erosion in the Andalusia Coast (sea-level rise associated to climate change); CSO2010-15807) and the other one by Andalusia regional government (Espacializacion y Difusion Web de Datos de Urbanizacion, y Fitodiversidad para el Analisis de Vulnerabilidad ante los Procesos de Inundacion Asociados a la Subida del Nivel del Mar en la Costa Andaluz; RNM-6207).",,51,16,16,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1400-0350,1874-7841,,J COAST CONSERV,J.

The CCM-Italian Ministry of Health ESCULAPIO project attempted to identify the role of such information sources, in order to address adequate strategies to improve information on vaccines and vaccine preventable diseases. In the present study, data on 632 adults from Southern Italy regarding information sources were collected, and their perceived and actual knowledge on vaccinations were compared and analyzed in relation to socio-demographic characteristics and information sources. The main reported reference sources were general practitioners (GPs) (42.5%) and pediatricians (33.1%), followed by mass media (24.1%) and the Internet (17.6%). A total of 45.4% reported they believed to be informed (45.4%), while those estimated to be truly informed were 43.8%. However, as showed in the multivariate logistic regression, people having the perception to be correctly informed ascribed their good knowledge to their profession in the health sector (Adj OR 2.28, CI 1.09-4.77, p < 0.05) and to friends/relatives/colleagues (AdjOR 6.25, CI 2.38-16.44, p < 0.001), while the non-informed population thought the responsibility had to be attributed to mass media (AdjOR 0.45, CI 0.22-0.92, p < 0.05). Those showing the real correct information, instead, were younger (AdjOR 1.64, CI 1.04-2.59, p < 0.05), and their main reference sources were pediatricians (AdjOR 1.63, CI 1.11-2.39, p < 0.05) and scientific magazines (Adj OR 3.39, CI 1.51-7.59, p < 0.01). Only 6% knew the VaccinarSi portal, developed to counter the widespred antivaccine websites in Italy. The post-survey significant increase of connections to VaccinarSi could be ascribed to the counselling performed during questionnaire administration. Strategies to improve information about vaccination should be addressed to fortifying healthcare workers knowledge in order to make them public health opinion leaders. General population should be provided with correct indications on trustworthy websites on vaccines to contrast false information supplied by anti-vaccinists on their own websites or social networks pages and on the mass media.","[Tabacchi, Garden; Costantino, Claudio; Cracchiolo, Manuela; Marchese, Valentina; Napoli, Giuseppe; Palmeri, Sara; Raia, Daniele; Restivo, Vincenzo; Vitale, Francesco; Casuccio, Alessandra] Univ Palermo, Hlth Promot & Mother Child Care GD Alessandro, Dept Sci, Via Vespro 133, I-90127 Palermo, Italy; [Ferro, Antonio] Azienda ULSS 22 Bussolengo VR, Verona, Italy; [Siddu, Andrea] Azienda ULSS 20, Verona, Italy","Tabacchi, G (corresponding author), Univ Palermo, Hlth Promot & Mother Child Care GD Alessandro, Dept Sci, Via Vespro 133, I-90127 Palermo, Italy.",tabacchi.garden@libero.it,"casuccio, alessandra/B-1730-2013; Costantino, Claudio/F-4742-2018","casuccio, alessandra/0000-0002-5676-9535; Costantino, Claudio/0000-0002-3397-7331; Siddu, Andrea/0000-0001-8212-3538",ESCULAPIO [CUP B33G13001190001]; Italian Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CCM) of the Ministry of Health,"This work was carried on within the project ESCULAPIO (CUP B33G13001190001), funded by the Italian Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CCM) of the Ministry of Health.

OBJECTIVE To develop a measure of parental knowledge about oSDB and AT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A sequential design was used for scale development. A prototype measure containing 9 oSDB and AT themes and 85 items was administered in survey format via an online platform. Participants included 19 clinician experts (otolaryngologists and pediatricians) and 13 laymen (parents of children who snore or do not snore, and other adults). Quantitative and qualitative responses were used to modify the measure and create the knowledge scale. Content validity of the scale was established through expert feedback and evaluation. Criterion validity was established with t test comparisons of experts with laymen. Reliability of the responses was assessed with Cronbach a testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES An 85-item prototype measure and 39-item modified measure were evaluated for consensus/approval and psychometric integrity. RESULTS Of 45 potential participants, 32 individuals (71%) responded to the prototype scale. Respondents included 19 clinician experts (59%) (otolaryngologists and pediatricians) and 13 laymen (41%) (parents of children who snore [n = 8] or do not snore [n = 2] and other adults [n = 3]); demographic data were not collected. Content analysis and qualitative feedback were largely rated positively: 27 respondents (84%) stated that the measure was a good evaluation of knowledge, 30 respondents (94%) commented that the items were clear, and 31 individuals (97%) approved of its organization, although there were several suggestions for rewording and/or addition of response options. Experts identified themes most important for assessing oSDB (symptoms) and AT (experiences: risks and benefits) knowledge. These qualitative comments were used to modify the scale, and items were eliminated if more than 2 were reported as misleading or less than 85% of clinicians provided correct responses. Five themes (oSDB symptoms, treatment options, AT risks, anesthesia, and AT benefits) and 39 items composed the final scale. Experts scored higher than laymen on the oSDB and AT Knowledge Scale for Parents overall (17 [94%] vs 12 [67%]; Cohen d = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.05-2.86) and within all themes, including experiences of children with oSDB (19 [88%] vs 13 [62%]; Cohen d = 1.53; 95% CI, 0.71-2.32), treatment options (19 [97%] vs 12 [68%]; Cohen d = 1.74; 95% CI, 0.88-2.57), AT risks (17 [97%] vs 12 [59%]; Cohen d = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.03-2.83), anesthesia (17 [97%] vs 12 [79%]; Cohen d = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.29-1.88), and AT benefits (17 [95%] vs 12 [67%]; Cohen d = 1.28; 95% CI, 0.46-2.09), demonstrating criterion validity. All responses demonstrated high reliability (Cronbach a = 0.94).

However, that augmentation can mislead if it is done incorrectly and not within reasonable limits. When procedures are in place for insuring that originals are archived, and image manipulation steps reported, scientists not only follow good laboratory practices, but avoid ethical issues associated with post processing, and protect their labs from any future allegations of scientific misconduct. Also, when procedures are in place for correct acquisition of images, the extent of post processing is minimized or eliminated. These procedures include white balancing (for brightfield images), keeping tonal values within the dynamic range of the detector, frame averaging to eliminate noise (typically in fluorescence imaging), use of the highest bit depth when a choice is available, flatfield correction, and archiving of the image in a non-lossy format (not JPEG). When post-processing is necessary, the commonly used applications for correction include Photoshop, and ImageJ, but a free program (GIMP) can also be used. Corrections to images include scaling the hit depth to higher and lower ranges, removing color casts from brightfield images, setting brightness and contrast, reducing color noise, reducing grainy noise, conversion of pure colors to grayscale, conversion of grayscale to colors typically used in fluorescence imaging, correction of uneven illumination (Hatfield correction), merging color images (fluorescence), and extending the depth of focus.

This paper analyzes the distribution of alternative facts and fake news as a phenomenon characterizing post-fact society and how journalistic work processes may promote and legitimize the distribution of misleading content. The study looks into the back- and front-stage performances of journalistic information processing that are influenced by social time acceleration and the insistence of 'click-bait' news criteria. We used three different methods for teaching news reporting on three different groups of Estonian journalism students, and analyzed their performance using self-reflection in focus group interviews. Two groups of students, whose assignments were geared toward the outcome, focused more on front stage performances and underestimated back stage performances, e.g. the evaluation of sources, background information gathering, and fact checking. One group, which was taught news reporting as a process of information filtering, perceived and reflected both front and back stage performances. The results indicate that (online) newsroom practice, which is influenced by time pressure and the continuous requirement of new content, may force journalists to skip the stages of conventional journalistic information processing and due to that create favorable environment for publishing and distributing misleading and fake news.","[Himma-Kadakas, Marju] Univ Tartu, Tartu, Estonia","Himma-Kadakas, M (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Inst Social Studies, Lossi 36-222, EE-51003 Tartu, Estonia.",marju.himma@ut.ee,"Himma-Kadakas, Marju/B-5244-2018","Himma-Kadakas, Marju/0000-0001-9441-7162",IUT of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [20-38],This work was supported by institutional research funding IUT (20-38) of the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research.,,45,7,7,2,9,"UNIV TECHNOLOGY, SYDNEY-UTS EPRESS",SYDNEY,"BROADWAY, PO BOX 123, SYDNEY, NSW 2007, AUSTRALIA",1837-5391,,,COSMOP CIV SOC,Cosmop.

Analysis of tweets in the wake of a rumor outbreak,ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Crisis informatics; User-generated content; Social media; Counter-rumor; Online rumors; Rumoring phenomena,WORD-OF-MOUTH; SOCIAL MEDIA; DISSEMINATION; CREDIBILITY; INTENTION; COMMUNITY; SENTIMENT; NETWORKS; HEALTH,"Purpose - In the wake of a rumor outbreak, individuals exchange three types of messages: rumor messages, counter-rumor messages, and uncertainty-expressing messages. However, the properties of the three types of messages are relatively unknown particularly in the social media context. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to examine these three types of messages posted on social media in the wake of a rumor outbreak. Design/methodology/approach - Data included tweets posted after the outbreak of a rumor that wrongly accused the fast food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) for selling rats instead of chicken. Using a deductive approach, codes were derived via content analysis on the tweets. Volume and exposure of tweets were also examined. Findings - Counter-rumor tweets (52 percent) outnumbered rumors tweets (32 percent) and uncertainty-expressing tweets (16 percent). Emotions and personal involvement were abundant in rumor tweets. Expressions of credence and references to URLs were high in counter-rumor tweets. Social ties were found widely in uncertainty-expressing tweets. The high volume and exposure of counter-rumor tweets compared with those of either rumor tweets or uncertainty-expressing tweets highlight the potential of counter-rumors to mitigate rumors. Originality/value - This research ventures into a relatively unexplored territory by concurrently examining rumor messages, counter-rumor messages and uncertainty-expressing messages in the wake of a rumor outbreak. It reveals that counter-rumor messages have the potential to mitigate rumors on social media.","[Pal, Anjan; Chua, Alton Y.

Although learning this procedure is a complex task, the use of simulation-based training provides significant advantages, such as enhanced patient safety. Access to bronchoscopy simulators may be limited in low-resource settings. We have developed a low-cost 3D-printed bronchoscopy training model. Methods: A parametric airway model was obtained from an online medical model repository and fabricated using a low-cost 3D printer. The participating physicians had no prior bronchoscopy experience. Participants received a 30-minute lecture on flexible bronchoscopy and were administered a 15-item pre-test questionnaire on bronchoscopy. Afterwards, participants were instructed to perform a series of predetermined bronchoscopy tasks on the 3D printed simulator on 4 consecutive occasions. The time needed to perform the tasks and the quality of task performance (identification of bronchial anatomy, technique, dexterity, lack of trauma) were recorded. Upon completion of the simulator tests, participants were administered the 15-item questionnaire (post-test) once again. Participant satisfaction data on the perceived usefulness and accuracy of the 3D model were collected. A statistical analysis was performed using the t-test. Data are reported as mean values (+/- standard deviation). Results: The time needed to complete all tasks was 152.9 +/- 71.5 sec on the 1st attempt vs. 98.7 +/- 40.3 sec on the 4th attempt (P = 0.03). Likewise, the quality of performance score improved from 8.3 +/- 6.7 to 18.2 +/- 2.5 (P < 0.0001). The average number of correct answers in the questionnaire was 6.8 +/- 1.9 pre-test and 13.3 +/- 3.1 post-test (P < 0.0001). Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the perceived usefulness and accuracy of the model. Conclusions: We developed a 3D-printed model for bronchoscopy training. This model improved trainee performance and may represent a valid, low-cost bronchoscopy training tool.","[Parotto, Matteo; Hiansen, Joshua Qua; Cooper, Richard; O'Leary, Gerald; Meineri, Massimiliano] Univ Toronto, Dept Anesthesia, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Parotto, Matteo; Cooper, Richard; O'Leary, Gerald; Meineri, Massimiliano] Univ Hlth Network, Toronto Gen Hosp, Dept Anesthesia & Pain Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [AboTaiban, Ahmed; Ioukhova, Svetlana; Agzamov, Alisher] Kuwait Canc Control Ctr, Dept Anesthesia & Intens Care Med, Kuwait, Kuwait","Meineri, M (corresponding author), Toronto Gen Hosp, Dept Anesthesia & Pain Management, 200 Elizabeth St EN3-400, Toronto, ON M5G 2C4, Canada.",massimiliano.meineri@uhn.ca,,,"Lynn & Arnold Irwin Foundation, Toronto, ON, Canada","The Lynn & Arnold Irwin Foundation, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,12,10,11,0,3,VIA MEDICA,GDANSK,"UL SWIETOKRZYSKA 73, 80-180 GDANSK, POLAND",1642-5758,1731-2531,,ANAESTH INTENSIVE TH,Anaesth.

Statistical tests (Chi-square, z-test) were used to identify significant differences between sex sub-groups at 95% confidence.Results: Overall, respondents correctly identified 67% of questions measuring literacy levels about male depression. Respondents' male suicide literacy was significantly poorer at 53.7%. Misperceptions were especially evident in terms of differentiating men's depressive symptoms from other mental illnesses, estimating prevalence and identifying factors linked to male suicide. Significant sex differences highlighted that females had higher literacy levels than men in regard to male depression.Conclusions: Implementing gender sensitive and specific programs to target and advance literacy levels about men's depression may be key to ultimately reducing depression and suicide among men in Canada.","[Oliffe, John L.] Univ British Columbia, Sch Nursing, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada; [Hannan-Leith, Madeline N.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Educ & Counselling Psychol & Special Educ, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Ogrodniczuk, John S.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychiat, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Black, Nick] Intens Consulting, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Mackenzie, Corey S.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Psychol, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Lohan, Maria] Queens Univ, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Belfast, Antrim, Ireland; [Creighton, Genevieve] Univ British Columbia, Dept Pediat, Vancouver, BC, Canada","Oliffe, JL (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Sch Nursing, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.",john.oliffe@nursing.ubc.ca,"Oliffe, John Lindsay/F-3436-2011","Oliffe, John Lindsay/0000-0001-9029-4003; Lohan, Maria/0000-0003-3525-1283; Black, Nick/0000-0003-3972-5976",Movember Canada for the Men's Depression and Suicide Network [11R18296],This work was supported Movember Canada for the Men's Depression and Suicide Network (www.menshealthresearch.-ubc.ca) by [ grant number # 11R18296].,,29,20,20,1,19,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0963-8237,1360-0567,,J MENT HEALTH,J.

Timely access to EC pills is critical because they are more likely to work the sooner they are taken. This study assesses whether LNG EC is sold in accordance with current Food and Drug Administration regulations. Methods: We distributed an online questionnaire through an EC-focused listserv for reproductive health professionals, asking data collectors to visit local stores and document product names, price, over-the-counter shelf availability, and misinformation about age restrictions. We used chi(2) analysis to assess bivariate associations and t tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to determine differences in means. Results: We collected information about 220 stores. The majority (65%) stocked EC on over-the-counter shelves, although only 22% of these displayed it without a locked security enclosure. Chain pharmacies were more likely to shelf-stock EC than independent pharmacies (77% vs. 5%; p = .000), but variation existed among stores within the same chain. Among stores that were asked, 40% incorrectly reported an age restriction for non-prescription purchase of LNG EC, whereas 95% correctly reported that men can buy LNG EC. The average price of branded and generic LNG EC was $49.64 and $40.05, respectively. Conclusions: Changes in the regulatory status of LNG EC have resulted in widespread confusion about how EC can be sold, and its high price contributes to access barriers. Retailers should ensure that consumers can access LNG EC quickly and easily by stocking the product on over-the-counter shelves and educating staff about current regulations.

Here, we introduce a new technique for crooked nose deformity repair. Twenty-two patients underwent intraoperative evaluations and measurements, followed by surgery using the open rhinoplasty technique. Our method involves three major steps. First is the creation of an asymmetric medial oblique osteotomy using piezoelectric ultrasonic surgery and double lateral osteotomies, wherein the asymmetric bony ascending part of the maxillary bone at the base of the nasal vault is fractured, pushed in, and delivered to the face. Second is septoplasty with L-strut preservation. The L-strut is removed as a 1-cm block caudally from the septal stump of the keystone area. A (or double) fabricated batten cartilage graft is placed on the concave side of the deviation and sutured to cover the septal stump. The L-strut is then replaced and sutured on the batten graft, redirecting the septum toward the midline. Third is an overlapping cruroplasty on the side of the long asymmetrical lower lateral cartilage to equalize both wings and correct tip deviation. Our new technique was effective for the treatment of crooked nose deformity. Our technique of K-stone batten plasty with delivery to the face and overlapping cruroplasty may be an effective surgical method for crooked nose deformity.

Research suggests that these resources, although informative and easily accessible, may contain misinformation, posing risk for product misuse and patient harm. Objective: Evaluate drug summaries within ODIC for accuracy and completeness and identify product-specific misinformation. Methods: Between August 2014 and January 2015, medical information (MI) specialists from 11 pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies systematically evaluated 270 drug summaries within 5 commonly used ODIC for misinformation. Using a standardized approach, errors were identified; classified as inaccurate, incomplete, or omitted; and categorized per sections of the Full Prescribing Information (FPI). On review of each drug summary, content-correction requests were proposed and supported by the respective product's FPI. Results: Across the 270 drug summaries reviewed within the 5 compendia, the median of the total number of errors identified was 782, with the greatest number of errors occurring in the categories of Dosage and Administration, Patient Education, and Warnings and Precautions. The majority of errors were classified as incomplete, followed by inaccurate and omitted. Conclusion: This analysis demonstrates that ODIC may contain misinformation.

Also, there is strong evidence that fixation of C2 anatomical pedicle has the best biomechanical profile of the entire cervical spine. However, it is often difficult and misleading, to evaluate anatomical bony and vascular anomalies using the three orthogonal planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) of CT. Objectives: The authors describe an innovative and simple technique to evaluate the feasibility of C2 pedicle for surgical screw fixation using preoperative planning with the free DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) software OsiriX (TM) . Materials and Methods: The authors report the applicatin of this novel technique in 5 cases (3 traumatic, 1 Os Odontoideum, and 1 complex congenital malformation) collected from our general case series of the Department in the last 5 years. Results: In this proof of concept study, the pre-operative analysis with the two-step tecnique was detrimental for choosing the surgical tecnique. Detailed post-operative analysis confirmed correct position of C2 screws without cortical breach. There were no complications or mortality reported. Conclusion: This two-step technique is an easy and reliable way to determine the feasibility of C2 pedicle for surgical fixation. The detailed tridimensional radiological preoperative evaluation of craniovertebral junction anatomy is critical to the sucess and safety of this surgeries, and can avoid, to certain degree, expensive intra-operative tridimensional imaging facilities.","[Sousa Marques, Luis Miguel; d'Almeida, Goncalo Neto; Cabral, Jose] Egas Moniz Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Rua Junqueira 126, P-1349019 Lisbon, Portugal","Marques, LMS (corresponding author), Egas Moniz Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Rua Junqueira 126, P-1349019 Lisbon, Portugal.",luismarques@campus.ul.pt,,,,,,19,1,2,0,0,MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS & MEDIA PVT LTD,MUMBAI,"B-9, KANARA BUSINESS CENTRE, OFF LINK RD, GHAKTOPAR-E, MUMBAI, 400075, INDIA",0974-8237,0976-9285,,J CRANIOVERTEBRAL JU,J.

To measure the point-absorbed dose and the 2D dose distribution for the patient's therapy plan, we fabricated a solid phantom that allowed for the insertion of an applicator for patient-specific QA and used an ion chamber and a film as measuring devices. The patient treatment plan was exported to the QA dose-calculation software, which calculated the time weight of dwell position stored in the plan DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) file to obtain an overall beam quality correction factor, and that correction was applied to the dose calculations. Experiments were conducted after importing the patient's treatment planning source data for the fabricated phantom and inserting the applicator, ion chamber, and film into the phantom. On completion of dose delivery, the doses to the ion chamber and film were checked against the corresponding treatment plan to evaluate the dosimetric accuracy. For experimental purposes, five treatment plans were randomly selected. The beam quality correction factors for ovoid and tandem brachytherapy applicators were found to be 1.15 and 1.10 - 1.12, respectively. The beam quality correction factor in tandem fluctuated by approximately 2%, depending on the changes in the dwell position. The doses measured by using the ion chamber showed differences ranging from -2.4% to 0.6%, compared to the planned doses. As for the film, the passing rate was 90% or higher when assessed using a gamma value of the local dose difference of 3% and a distance to agreement of 3 mm. The results show that the self-fabricated phantom was suitable for QA in clinical settings. The proposed patient-specific QA for the treatment planning is expected to contribute to reduce dosimetric errors in brachytherapy and, thus, to enhancing treatment accuracy.","[Lee, Boram; Sim, Jina; Yoon, Myonggeun] Korea Univ, Dept Bioconvergence Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Lee, Boram; Ahn, Sung Hwan; Kim, Hyeyoung; Han, Youngyih; Huh, Seung Jae] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Med, Samsung Med Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, Seoul 06351, South Korea; [Kim, Jin Sung] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Yonsei Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Kim, Dong Wook] Kyung Hee Univ Hosp Gangdong, Dept Radiat Oncol, Seoul 05278, South Korea","Yoon, M (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Dept Bioconvergence Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.",radioyoon@korea.ac.kr,,,"National Nuclear R&D Program through National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [NRF-2015M2A2A7A02045273, NRF-2013M2A2A7067089]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIP) [NRF-2014R1A1A3053958]","This work was supported by the National Nuclear R&D Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (NRF-2015M2A2A7A02045273, NRF-2013M2A2A7067089) and by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant (No. NRF-2014R1A1A3053958) funded by the Korean government (MSIP).",,35,0,0,0,2,KOREAN PHYSICAL SOC,SEOUL,"635-4, YUKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-KU, SEOUL 135-703, SOUTH KOREA",0374-4884,1976-8524,,J KOREAN PHYS SOC,J.

The bidirectional transmission line coupler based electromagnetic clip connector, which can be used to make local area network connections similar to clips, suppresses the signal reflections on the bus enabling 280 Mb/s data rate which is 7 times faster than the state-of-the-art in-vehicle LAN transceiver. Since all modules are connected with the shortest distance, this connection system can reduce wire harness weight by 30%. Forward error correction is done by N-x Manchester encoding on the transmitter side and majority voting on the receiver side. High noise immunity is achieved through synchronous receiving by the digital clock recovery circuit which is robust against noise. Communication tests were conducted at 280 Mb/s with 10 transceivers fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology connected by a 10 m unshielded twisted pair cable.

Microblogs - a type of social media application such as Twitter or Weibo - have served as an important platform for network governance in some local governments in China. This study makes an attempt to answer the following questions: What types of strategies should governments implement on social media platforms during public emergencies? What are the effects of these strategies? Based on the case of the Shifang Incident, which was a large-scale environmental protest that occurred in Shifang, China in 2012, we analyze all the messages posted during the incident on the official microblog of the Shifang government and examine the public feedback by using an online big data analysis tool. In line with the time sequence and the extent of the conflict, we divide the Shifang Incident into three phases: the fermentation period, the confrontation period, and the digestion period. In addition, we classify government strategies on social media into five categories: introducing, appealing, explaining, rumor-refuting, and decision-making. The analysis results show that different government strategies are applied to different phases of the incident and that the responses of the public also vary during different periods.","[Meng, Qingguo; Zhang, Nan; Zhao, Xuejiao] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Fangling] China Mobile Univ, Beijing 102200, Peoples R China; [Guan, Xin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Zhang, N (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",nanzhang@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,Tsinghua University Institute for Data Science; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71473143/71490721/71102010]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15ZDA039]; Beijing Social Science Foundation [15JGA008]; Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program [20131089260],"This work was partly supported by Tsinghua University Institute for Data Science, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71473143/71490721/71102010), the National Social Science Foundation of China (15ZDA039), the Beijing Social Science Foundation (15JGA008), and the Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Program (20131089260).",,47,11,11,10,112,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1019-6781,1422-8890,,ELECTRON MARK,Electron.

In the last four years, we have been working on the INGVterremoti blog in order to provide quick updates on the ongoing seismic activity in Italy and in-depth scientific information. These include articles on specific historical earthquakes, seismic hazard, geological interpretations, source models from different types of data, effects at the surface, and so on. We have delivered information in quasi-real-time also about all the recent magnitude A/14.0 earthquakes in Italy, as well as on the strongest events that occurred in the Mediterranean and in the world. During the 2016, central Italy earthquake sequence, the INGVterremoti blog has continuously released information with three types of posts: i) updates on the ongoing seismic activity; ii) reports on the activities carried out by the INGV teams in the field and by other working groups; iii) in-depth scientific articles describing some specific analysis and results. All the blog posts have been shared automatically and in real time on the other social media of the INGVterremoti platform, also to counter the bad information, and to fight rumors. These include Facebook, Twitter and the INGVterremoti App on IOS and Android. As well, both the main INGV home page (www.ingv.it) and the INGV earthquake portal (htip://turcnioti.inv.11) have published the contents of the blog on dedicated pages that were fed automatically. The work done day by day on the INGVterremoti blog has been coordinated with the INGV Press Office that has written several press releases based on the contents of the blog. Since August 24th, 53 articles were published on the blog, and they have had more than 1.9 million views and 1 million visitors.

Current ICT tools are immature, but a brighter future looms. We examine 7 areas of ICT in healthcare: electronic healthrecords (EHRs), health information exchange(HIE), patient portals, telemedicine, social media, mobile devices and wearable sensors and monitors, and privacy and security. In each of these areas, we examine the current status and future promise, highlighting how each might reach its promise. Steps to better EHRs include a universal programming interface, universal patient identifiers, improved documentation and improved data analysis. HIEs require federal subsidies for sustainability and support from EHR vendors, targeting seamless sharing of EHRdata. Patient portals must bring patients into the EHR with better designand training, greater provider engagement and leveraging HIEs. Telemedicine needs sustainable payment models, clear rules of engagement, quality measures and monitoring. Social media needs consensus on rules of engagement for providers, better datamining tools and approaches to counter disinformation. Mobile and wearable devices benefit from a universal programming interface, improved infrastructure, more rigorous research and integration with EHRs and HIEs. Laws for privacy and security need updating to match current technologies, and data stewards should share information on breaches and standardize best practices.

Analysis of spatially distributed particles on these devices typically requires microscopy negating the cost and size advantages of microfluidic assays. In this paper, we introduce a scalable electronic sensor technology, called microfluidic CODES, that utilizes resistive pulse sensing to orthogonally detect particles in multiple microfluidic channels from a single electrical output. Combining the techniques from telecommunications and microfluidics, we route three coplanar electrodes on a glass substrate to create multiple Coulter counters producing distinct orthogonal digital codes when they detect particles. We specifically design a digital code set using the mathematical principles of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) telecommunication networks and can decode signals from different microfluidic channels with > 90% accuracy through computation even if these signals overlap. As a proof of principle, we use this technology to detect human ovarian cancer cells in four different microfluidic channels fabricated using soft lithography. Microfluidic CODES offers a simple, all-electronic interface that is well suited to create integrated, low-cost lab-on-a-chip devices for cell-or particle-based assays in resource-limited settings.","[Liu, Ruxiu; Wang, Ningquan; Kamili, Farhan; Sarioglu, A.

This requires stakeholders to radically re-think their existing business models (and thinking that underpins them), but also the technological challenges and skills required to deliver these projects. Whilst opponents will no doubt cite that this is nothing new as the sector as a whole has always had to respond to change; the counter to this is that design 'creativity' is now much more dependent on integration from day one. Given this, collaborative processes embedded in Building Information Modelling (BIM) models have been proffered as a panacea solution to embrace this change and deliver streamlined integration. The veracity of design teams' project data is increasingly becoming paramount - not only for the coordination of design, processes, engineering services, fabrication, construction, and maintenance; but more importantly, facilitate 'true' project integration and interchange - the actualisation of which will require firm consensus and commitment. This Special Issue envisions some of these issues, challenges and opportunities (from a future landscape perspective), by highlighting a raft of concomitant factors, which include: technological challenges, design visualisation and integration, future digital tools, new and anticipated operating environments, and training requirements needed to deliver these aspirations. A fundamental part of this Special Issue's 'call' was to capture best practice in order to demonstrate how design, visualisation and delivery processes (and technologies) affect the finished product viz: design outcome, design procedures, production methodologies and construction implementation. In this respect, the use of virtual environments are now particularly effective at supporting the design and delivery processes. In summary therefore, this Special Issue presents nine papers from leading scholars, industry and contemporaries. These papers provide an eclectic (but cognate) representation of AEC design visualisation and integration; which not only uncovers new insight and understanding of these challenges and solutions, but also provides new theoretical and practice signposts for future research.","[Goulding, Jack Steven; Rahimian, Farzad Pour] Univ Cent Lancashire, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England","Goulding, JS (corresponding author), Univ Cent Lancashire, Preston PR1 2HE, Lancs, England.",JSGoulding@uclan.ac.uk,"Goulding, Jack/F-8417-2012; Rahimian, Farzad/Q-6332-2016","Goulding, Jack/0000-0002-9039-7464; Rahimian, Farzad/0000-0001-7443-4723",,,,14,2,2,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",,1938-7806,,ARCHNET-IJAR,Archnet-IJAR,NOV,2015,9,3,,,SI,,1,5,,,,,5,Architecture,Architecture,V21TR,WOS:000214977000001,,,,,2020-12-18,

In areas of low bone presentation, standardized plate-like titanium implants are available. For allowing a congruent fitting to the recipient site, these contemporary implants have to be manually adaptedimplicating drawbacks in terms of time consumption, technical complexity, and insufficient functional outcome. Owing to these limitations, a custom-made patient-specific implant is introduced based on Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data and designed for optimal prosthetic reconstruction.Methods:For the first time, the application of a prefabricated patient-specific implant for retaining a craniofacial prosthesis is described. In a 64-year-old man with partial nasal defect standardized plate-like implants failed because of compromised bone quality due to Osler disease. To realize an implant-retained prosthetic reconstruction, a patient-specific implant was fabricated based on computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology. This technique allows for considering the implant's ideal geometry as well as its correct placement of the required magnetic abutments. Furthermore, the surface of the implant can be designed for optimal hygienic conditions.Results:The patient-specific implant was successfully inserted in a time effective operating procedure. Follow-up at 6 months showed an excellent functional and aesthetic outcome.Conclusions:Application of prefabricated patient-specific implants offers prospectively an ideal tool for retaining craniofacial prostheses and should be considered a viable option in standard cases, but obligatory in anatomically demanding defects.","[Toso, Sabine Maria; Menzel, Kerstin; Motzkus, Yvonne; Adolphs, Nicolai; Hoffmeister, Bodo; Raguse, Jan-Dirk] Charite, Dept Craniomaxillofacial Surg, Surg Nav, D-13353 Berlin, Germany","Toso, SM (corresponding author), Charite, Dept Craniomaxillofacial Surg, Surg Nav, Campus Virchow Klinikum,Augustenburger Pl 1, D-13353 Berlin, Germany.",sabine.toso@charite.de,,,,,,16,11,10,0,6,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1049-2275,1536-3732,,J CRANIOFAC SURG,J.

In this study, a comparison of SAW- and QCM-based sensors is performed for the detection of low concentrations of Hg-0 vapor (ranging from 24 to 365 ppbv). Experimental measurements and finite element method (FEM) simulations allow the comparison of these sensors with regard to their sensitivity, sorption and desorption characteristics, and response time following Hg-0 vapor exposure at various operating temperatures ranging from 35 to 75 degrees C. Both of the sensors were fabricated on quartz substrates (ST and AT cut quartz for SAW and QCM devices, respectively) and employed thin gold (Au) layers as the electrodes. The SAW-based sensor exhibited up to similar to 111 and similar to 39 times higher response magnitudes than did the QCM-based sensor at 35 and 55 degrees C, respectively, when exposed to Hg-0 vapor concentrations ranging from 24 to 365 ppbv. The Hg-0 sorption and desorption calibration curves of both sensors were found to fit well with the Langmuir extension isotherm at different operating temperatures. Furthermore, the Hg-0 sorption and desorption rate demonstrated by the SAW-based sensor was found to decrease as the operating temperature increased, while the opposite trend was observed for the QCM-based sensor. However, the SAW-based sensor reached the maximum Hg-0 sorption rate faster than the QCM-based sensor regardless of operating temperature, whereas both sensors showed similar response times (t(90)) at various temperatures. Additionally, the sorption rate data was utilized in this study in order to obtain a faster response time from the sensor upon exposure to Hg-0 vapor. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the developed sensors selectivity showed that the SAW-based sensor had a higher overall selectivity (90%) than did the QCM counterpart (84%) while Hg-0 vapor was measured in the presence of ammonia (NH3), humidity, and a number of volatile organic compounds at the chosen operating temperature of 55 degrees C.","[Kabir, K.

The clean level of the system is estimated by measuring separately each clean-localized component of the system including a minimal shipping case, wafer carrier, wafer load-lock system, and machine process chamber using a particle counter. The clean level of the system is analyzed to be in the ISO class 4, which is in the same class of a super clean room. In order to confirm the cleanliness needed for device fabrications, we employ a lithography system of the minimal fab consisting of a minimal coater, a minimal maskless exposure system using digital light processing technique, and a minimal developer hybridizing with conventional fab equipment to fabricate a metaloxide-semiconductor (MOS) field-effect-transistors (FET).

In micro-fluidic applications dealing with soft biological fluids very often, digital micro-valves [also known as Quake valves (Unger et al. in Science 288:113, 2000)] are deployed to start/stop flows in pressurized micro-channels. These valves are designed in a manner so that the actuation is performed by a control micro-channel filled with compressed air seating on the top of another micro-channel filled with fluidic sample. The response time of these valves is so miniscule that they almost close immediately qualifying them to be digital in nature. Still in applications like drug screening where a small amount of intermixing may have a counterintuitive effect on the whole experiment, the valves may underperform. In order to address the problem of leakages/leaching of fluids across a fully pressure-closed digital micro-valve, we have tried to incorporate a design modification with a completely different fabrication process, wherein the closing approach of a Quake valve has been varied from top down to radially inwards across the whole cross-section of the micro-channel. The design of this valve enables its wide applicability to embedded micro-fluidics, which is widely used to mimic/study the flow of body fluids across our vasculature or is highly useful for chip cooling applications. Micro-valving has been seldom explored in the embedded domain, and the current architecture of the micro-valve in a way fills this technology gap. In our design, two concentric hollow tracks, one straight and another helical are replicated in polydimethyl siloxane using preformed 80-micron copper wires that are of circular cross-section. Compressed oxygen is passed through the helical channel to control the fluid flow in the concentrically placed straight micro-channel. The micro-valve controls the fluid flow by applying uniform pressure homogeneously on micro-channel wall so that the wall can collapse and close the channel cross-section (stop condition). The system has been designed and simulated using COMSOL multi-physics platform where a design optimization was carried out in details in an earlier work (Singh et al. in Microsyst Technol. doi:10.1007/s00542-013-1738-7, 2013). In this work, we have evaluated the design experimentally through monitoring the inlet/outlet flow rate in the central micro-channel through microparticle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) analysis on opened/closed valve conditions. A flow behavior of the central micro-channel is simulated using COMSOL multi-physics platform, and the pre/post-valving discharge have been estimated theoretically for various input flow rate conditions at a corresponding air pressure of 5 psi in the helical track. We have further validated this through micro-PIV experiments wherein the valving behavior observed is different to the extent of the transient flow part but quite similar as regards the steady-state part.","[Singh, Rajeev Kumar; Kant, Rishi; Singh, Sushant; Suresh, E.; Gupta, Ankur; Bhattacharya, Shantanu] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Microsyst Fabricat Lab, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India","Bhattacharya, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Microsyst Fabricat Lab, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.",bhattacs@iitk.ac.in,"Kant, Rishi/B-4693-2018; Kant, Rishi/Y-7927-2019","Kant, Rishi/0000-0002-6089-5219; Kant, Rishi/0000-0002-6089-5219; Bhattacharya, Shantanu/0000-0002-7902-2119; GUPTA, ANKUR/0000-0001-7855-2145",,,,26,4,4,0,56,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1613-4982,1613-4990,,MICROFLUID NANOFLUID,Microfluid.

The increasingly widespread use of the Internet by the population to collect information regarding health and medical treatments and the circulation of many non-scientific documents on the effectiveness and safety of vaccines has led the Italian Society of Hygiene (Sltl), in 2013, to promote a portal to provide scientific information that is verified and easily understood to counteract the rampant misinformation on health treatments and combat the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. Methods. The project was launched in May 2013 and provides a portal with six main sections (vaccine preventable diseases, registered vaccines, benefits and risks of vaccination, against misinformation, pros & cons and travel immunizations) and other headings that relate to scientific events, comics and news coverage concerning vaccines. The contents are validated and evaluated by a scientific committee of high profile scientists and experts in computer-mediated communication. Results. In the first two years of activity, the portal has published more than 250 web pages on all aspects related to vaccinations. The number of individual users was 860,411, with a constant increase over time. Of these, about 21.7% returned to the website at least once. The total visits in 24 months were 1,099,670, with a total page count of 2,530,416. The frequency of contact was almost exclusively Italian (95.6%), with a higher proportion of males (54.1%) and younger age groups (25-34 years, 33.5%, and18-24 years, 27.5%). The data also show a significant position of the website in the major web search engines. The website has been certified by the Health On the Net Foundation. It is connected with the main social networks and it has recently opened its first regional section (Veneto). Conclusions. The strong, progressive increase in web contacts, the involvement of several inrdtudona| bodies, and the appreciation of various stakeholders give an absolutely positive assessment of the first two years of the VaccinarSi project. The success of the vvebsite suggests future developments, with updates, sections devoted to regional problems, in-depth news analysis, and international expansion.

With the propagation of the internet, public health officials must now compete with other official and unofficial sources of information to get their message out. Aims: This study aimed at critically appraising videos available on one popular internet video site (YouTube) as a source of information for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Materials and Methods: Videos were searched in YouTube (http://www.youtube.com) using the keyword Ebola outbreak from inception to November 1, 2014 with the default relevance filter. Only videos in English language under 10 min duration within first 10 pages of search were included. Duplicates were removed and the rest were classified as useful or misleading by two independent reviewers. Video sources were categorized by source. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient. Continuous and categorical variables were analyzed using the Student t-test and Chi-squared test, respectively. Results: One hundred and eighteen out of 198 videos were evaluated. Thirty-one (26.27%) videos were classified as misleading and 87 (73.73%) videos were classified as useful. The kappa coefficient of agreement regarding the usefulness of the videos was 0.68 (P < 0.001). Independent users were more likely to post misleading videos (93.55% vs 29.89%, OR = 34.02, 95% CI = 7.55-153.12, P < 0.001) whereas news agencies were most likely to post useful videos (65.52% vs 3.23%, OR = 57.00, 95% CI = 7.40-438.74, P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that majority of the internet videos about Ebola on YouTube were characterized as useful. Although YouTube seems to generally be a useful source of information on the current outbreak, increased efforts to disseminate scientifically correct information is desired to prevent unnecessary panic among the among the general population.","[Pathak, Ranjan; Poudel, Dilli Ram; Karmacharya, Paras; Aryal, Madan Raj; Mahmood, Maryam; Donato, Anthony A.] Reading Hlth Syst, Dept Med, W Reading, PA USA; [Pathak, Amrit] Tribhuwan Univ Teaching Hosp, Dept Med, Kathmandu, Nepal","Pathak, R (corresponding author), Reading Hlth Syst, 6th Ave & Spruce St, W Reading, PA 19611 USA.",ranjanrp@gmail.com,"Karmacharya, Paras/ABA-5245-2020; Poudel, Dilli/Q-9900-2018","Karmacharya, Paras/0000-0003-1034-1530; Poudel, Dilli/0000-0003-2350-719X; Mahmood, Maryam/0000-0001-9613-2347",,,,5,26,26,2,10,MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS & MEDIA PVT LTD,MUMBAI,"B-9, KANARA BUSINESS CENTRE, OFF LINK RD, GHAKTOPAR-E, MUMBAI, 400075, INDIA",2250-1541,1947-2714,,N AM J MED SCI,N.

Detecting relative ratios enables capturing the scene features and patterns almost independently from the local scene illumination resulting in potentially extremely high dynamic range. Moreover, detecting signal ratios using a fully differential circuit optimally suits the intrinsic nature of very large scale integrated design. A scalable and compact hardware implementation is proposed as a proof-of-concept toward relative image acquisition. The proposed photo-current-ratio-detecting pixels completely bypass the need of conventional photo-current integration which enables high frame-rate operation of up to 24 000 frames/s. The pulse-width-modulated output of the proposed pixel is captured by compact column-parallel readout circuits based on digital counters. The developed 32 x 32 pixel array prototype CMOS image sensor consumes 4 mW of power operating at a nominal 9765 frames/s frame rate, and 6.8 mW of power operating at a maximum 24 000 frames/s. The presented prototype design is fully scalable toward newer CMOS fabrication nodes and higher sensor resolution.","[Katic, Nikola; Popovic, Vladan; Cojbasic, Radisav; Schmid, Alexandre; Leblebici, Yusuf] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Microelect Syst Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland","Katic, N (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Microelect Syst Lab, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",katic.nik@gmail.com; vladan.popovic@epfl.ch; radisav.cojbasic@epfl.ch; alexandre.schmid@epfl.ch; yusuf.leblebici@epfl.ch,,,Swiss National Foundation (SNSF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [200020-146369],This work was supported by the Swiss National Foundation (SNSF) under Project 200020-146369.

Methods Four national and 82 local (British Columbia) Canadian online news sites were searched for articles posted between August 2012 and May 2013 containing the words healthcare workers and mandatory influenza vaccinations/immunizations or mandatory flu shots and healthcare workers. We included articles from sources that predominantly concerned our topic of interest and that generated reader comments. Two researchers coded the unedited comments using thematic analysis, categorizing codes to allow themes to emerge. In addition to themes, the comments were categorized by: 1) sentiment towards influenza vaccines; 2) support for mandatory vaccination policies; 3) citing of reference materials or statistics; 4) self-identified health-care worker status; and 5) sharing of a personal story. Results 1163 comments made by 648 commenters responding to 36 articles were analyzed. Popular themes included concerns about freedom of choice, vaccine effectiveness, patient safety, and distrust in government, public health, and the pharmaceutical industry. Almost half (48%) of commenters expressed a negative sentiment toward the influenza vaccine, 28% were positive, 20% were neutral, and 4% expressed mixed sentiment. Of those who commented on the policy, 75% did not support the condition to work policy, while 25% were in favour. Of the commenters, 11% self-identified as healthcare workers, 13% shared personal stories, and 18% cited a reference or statistic. Interpretation The perception of the influenza vaccine in the comment sections of online news sites is fairly poor. Public health agencies should consider including online forums, comment sections, and social media sites as part of their communication channels to correct misinformation regarding the benefits of HCW influenza immunization and the effectiveness of the vaccine.","[Lei, Yang; Pereira, Jennifer A.; Quach, Susan; Kwong, Jeffrey C.; Garber, Gary; Feinberg, Yael] Publ Hlth Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Lei, Yang; Garber, Gary; Feinberg, Yael] Univ Toronto, Fac Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Bettinger, Julie A.] Vaccine Evaluat Ctr, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Bettinger, Julie A.] British Columbia Childrens Hosp, Vancouver, BC V6H 3V4, Canada; [Bettinger, Julie A.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Kwong, Jeffrey C.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kwong, Jeffrey C.] Inst Clin Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Kwong, Jeffrey C.] Univ Toronto, Dept Family & Community Med, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Kwong, Jeffrey C.] Univ Hlth Network, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Corace, Kimberly; Garber, Gary] Ottawa Hosp, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Corace, Kimberly; Garber, Gary] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Corace, Kimberly; Feinberg, Yael] Univ Ottawa, Mental Hlth Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Guay, Maryse] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Sci Sante Communautaire, Longueuil, PQ, Canada; [Guay, Maryse] Inst Natl Sante publ Quebec, Longueuil, PQ, Canada; [Guay, Maryse] Hop Charles LeMoyne, Ctr Rech, Longueuil, PQ, Canada; [Guay, Maryse] Agence Sante & Serv Sociaux Monteregie, Ctr Rech, Longueuil, PQ, Canada","Guay, M (corresponding author), Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Sci Sante Communautaire, Longueuil, PQ, Canada.",maryse.guay.agence16@ssss.gouv.qc.ca,"McGeer, Allison/AAB-6885-2020","McGeer, Allison/0000-0001-5647-6137; Bettinger, Julie/0000-0002-2118-4174",,,,39,1,1,0,33,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUN 18,2015,10,6,,,,,,,e0129993,10.1371/journal.pone.0129993,,,12,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,CK9NT,WOS:000356567500072,26086194,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-18,

On the flip side, it has resulted in various forms of security vulnerabilities in the supply chain that involves designers, fabs, test facilities, and distributors until the end-product reaches customers. One of the biggest threats to semiconductor industry today is the entry of aged, reject, or cloned parts, that is, counterfeit chips, into the supply chain, leading to annual revenue losses in the order of billions of dollars. While traceability of chips between trusted parties can help monitor the supply chain at various points in the flow, existing solutions are in the form of integrating costly hardware units on chip, or utilizing easy-to-circumvent inspection-based detection techniques. In this article, we propose a technique for adaptive unique ID generation that leverages process variations, enabling chip traceability. The proposed method stimulates digital chips with an analog signal from the supply lines, which serve as primary inputs to each gate in the signal path. Using a sinusoidal signal that exercises the transistors as gain components, we create a chip-specific response that can be post-processed into a digital ID. The proposed technique enables quick and cost-effective authenticity validation that requires no on-chip hardware support. Our simulation and experimentation on actual chips show that the proposed technique is capable of generating unique IDs even in the presence of environmental noise.","[Suresh, Chandra K.

This study aimed to investigate the use, relevance and challenges of Wikipedia among medical students. Methods: An online questionnaire was made accessible to students at five medical universities in Germany, Austria, and Norway. Besides demographical data, the questions covered the role of Wikipedia in the academic life of medical students. The questionnaire investigated if the students had ever found erroneous medical entries and whether they corrected these. Results: A frequent use of Wikipedia in general is statistically significant correlated with a frequent use in medical studies (p < 0.001). Information retrieved from Wikipedia is predominantly critically appraised either by comparing it to profound knowledge (79%) and/or to specific literature (75%). Despite most (97%) respondents disclosed that they already had found false information in Wikipedia, recognized errors were seldomly corrected (similar to 20%). Conclusions: The information retrieved from Wikipedia is critically appraised. However, we found shortcomings in handling erroneous entries. We argue for professional responsibility among medical students in dealing with this dynamic resource.

This study aimed to investigate the practice of self-medication with antibiotics to treat URTIs in Australian Chinese migrants and to understand whether their knowledge of antibiotics, attitudes to and perceptions of antibiotic use was associated with self-medication of antibiotics. Methods: Four hundred and seventeen participants were recruited in an online health survey involving a bilingual questionnaire through several Australian-based Chinese social websites. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to explore the associations between self-medication and antibiotic-related knowledge, attitudes, and perception factors. Results: Around 24.2% of Chinese migrants used antibiotics without medical consultation for URTIs. Almost 70% of Chinese migrants indicated that they would stop taking antibiotics when symptoms improved; around 61% would use leftover antibiotics if they had similar symptoms. Furthermore, participants who would use leftover antibiotics (OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.7-5.6), or who would take an incomplete course of antibiotics (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-3.1) were more likely to report self-medication with antibiotics. Participants who perceived it was appropriate to use antibiotics for fever, cough and sore throat were at a greater risk of self-medication with antibiotics for URTIs. Conclusion: A considerable number of Chinese migrants used antibiotics for URTIs without medical consultation in Australia. Misperceptions about antibiotic use were significantly associated with the practice of self-medicating in this group. The findings provided important information for developing culturally responsive interventions for the correct use of antibiotics in Australian Chinese communities.","[Hu, Jie; Wang, Zhiqiang] Univ Queensland, Sch Med, Ctr Chron Dis, Herston, Qld 4029, Australia","Hu, J (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Med, Ctr Chron Dis, Herston, Qld 4029, Australia.",j.hu1@uq.edu.au,"Wang, Zhiqiang/A-5835-2010","Wang, Zhiqiang/0000-0002-5839-743X; Hu, Jie/0000-0003-2940-6525",National Health & Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC)National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia [APP1042343],"This project was supported by National Health & Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC, APP1042343).",,28,6,6,1,1,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1835-5617,1835-5625,,HEALTHC INFECT,Healthc.

By injecting input data edges into the oscillator embedded in a classical Type-II digital clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit, the proposed receiver achieves instantaneous phase-locking and input jitter filtering simultaneously. In other words, the proposed CDR combines the advantages of conventional feed-forward and feedback architectures to achieve energy-proportional operation. By controlling the number of data edges injected into the oscillator, both the jitter transfer bandwidth and the jitter tolerance corner are accurately controlled. The feedback loop also corrects for any frequency error and helps improve CDR's immunity to oscillator frequency drift during the power-on and -off states. This also improves CDR's tolerance to consecutive identical digits present in the input data. Fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process, the prototype receiver instantaneously locks onto the very first data edge and consumes 6.1 mW at 2.2 Gb/s. Owing to its short power-on time, the receiver's energy efficiency varies only from 2.77 pJ/bit to 3.87 pJ/bit when the effective data rate is varied from 0.44 Gb/s to 2.2 Gb/s. Input sensitivity of the receiver is 36 mV for a BER of 10(-12).","[Choi, Woo-Seok; Anand, Tejasvi; Shu, Guanghua; Hanumolu, Pavan Kumar] Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Elshazly, Amr] Intel Corp, Hillsboro, OR 97124 USA","Choi, WS (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",wchoi33@illinois.edu,,,"Intel Labs University Research Office, Semiconductor Research Corporation [1836.129]; National Science Foundation (NSF) under CAREERNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EECS-0954969]; Directorate For EngineeringNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1405176] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Electrical, Commun & Cyber SysNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG) [1405176] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was supported in part by Intel Labs University Research Office, Semiconductor Research Corporation under task ID: 1836.129, and by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under CAREER Award EECS-0954969.",,26,13,13,0,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9200,1558-173X,,IEEE J SOLID-ST CIRC,IEEE J.

One example is a monocentric lens, which forms a wide field-of-view high-resolution spherical image with a radius equal to the focal length. Optical fiber bundles have been used to couple between this focal surface and planar image sensors. However, such fiber-coupled imaging systems suffer from artifacts due to image sampling and incoherent light transfer by the fiber bundle as well as resampling by the focal plane, resulting in a fixed obscuration pattern. Here, we describe digital image processing techniques to improve image quality in a compact 126 degrees field-of-view, 30 megapixel panoramic imager, where a 12 mm focal length F/1.35 lens made of concentric glass surfaces forms a spherical image surface, which is fiber-coupled to six discrete CMOS focal planes. We characterize the locally space-variant system impulse response at various stages: monocentric lens image formation onto the 2.5 mu m pitch fiber bundle, image transfer by the fiber bundle, and sensing by a 1.75 mu m pitch backside illuminated color focal plane. We demonstrate methods to mitigate moire artifacts and local obscuration, correct for sphere to plane mapping distortion and vignetting, and stitch together the image data from discrete sensors into a single panorama.

However, limited vision in the operative site may lead to difficulties or complications during surgery. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective method for helping surgeons to perform MAO more precisely and safely. In this study, we report a novel method of a computer image-guided surgical template for navigation of MAO, and evaluate its accuracy and clinical outcomes. Nine patients with a prominent mandibular angle were enrolled in this study. A pair of stereolithographic templates was fabricated by computer-aided image design and 3D printing. In all cases, bilateral MAO was performed under the guide of these templates. Post-operative effects were evaluated by 3D curve functions and maximal shell-to-shell deviations. All patients were satisfied with their cosmetic outcomes. The mean and SD of ICC between R-Sim and R-Post were 0.958 +/- A 0.011; between L-Sim and L-Post, 0.965 +/- A 0.014; and between R-Post and L-Post, 0.964 +/- A 0.013. The maximal shell-to-shell deviations between the simulated mandibular contour and post-operative mandibular contour on the right and left sides were 2.02 +/- A 0.32 and 1.97 +/- A 0.41 mm, respectively. The results of this study suggest that this new technique could assist surgeons in making better pre-surgical plans and ensure more accurate and safer manipulation for completion of this procedure.

By utilizing inexpensive manufacturing methods such as ink-jet printing and roll-to-roll imprinting, flexible electronics can be made on low-cost plastic films just like printing newspapers. However, the key elements of flexible electronics, thin-film transistors (TFTs), have slower operating speeds and are less reliable than their Si electronics counterparts. Furthermore, TFTs are usually mono-type-either p-or n-type -devices. Making air-stable complementary TFT circuits is very challenging or sometimes not feasible to most TFT technologies. Existing design methodologies for Si electronics, therefore, cannot be directly applied to flexible electronics. Other factors such as high supply voltage, large process variation, and lack of trustworthy device modeling also make designing larger-scale and robust TFT circuits a significant challenge. The objective of this article is to provide an in-depth overview of flexible electronics from their applications, manufacturing processes, device characteristics, to circuit and system design solutions. We first introduce the low-cost fabrication methods for flexible electronics, including ink-jet printing, screen printing, and gravure printing. The device characteristics and compact modeling of several major TFT technologies will be illustrated. We will then give an overview of digital and analog circuit design from basic logic gates to a microprocessor, as well as design automation tools and methods, for designing flexible electronics. We also describe a reliability simulation framework that can predict TFT circuits' performance degradation under bias-stress. This framework has been validated using the amorphous-silicon (a-Si) TFT scan driver for TFT-LCD displays. Finally, we will give an overview of flexible thin-film photovoltaics using different materials including amorphous silicon, CdTe, CIGS, and organic solar cells.","[Huang, Tsung-Ching (Jim)] Hewlett Packard Labs, Palo Alto, CA USA; [Huang, Jiun-Lang] Natl Taiwan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Cheng, Kwang-Ting (Tim)] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Huang, TC (corresponding author), Hewlett Packard Labs, Palo Alto, CA USA.",tsung-ching.huang@hp.com; jlhuang@cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw; timcheng@ece.ucsb.edu,,,,,,117,0,0,0,8,NOW PUBLISHERS INC,HANOVER,"PO BOX 1024, HANOVER, MA 02339 USA",1551-3939,1551-3947,,FOUND TRENDS ELECTRO,Found.

The temporal resolution of the conventional pulse-shrinking mechanism is determined by the size ratio between homogeneous and inhomogeneous elements. The proposed scheme which features double-stage operation derives its resolution according to the time difference between pulse-shrinking and pulse-stretching amounts. Thus, it can achieve greater immunity against temperature and ambient variations than that of the single-stage scheme. The circuit area also can be reduced by the proposed pulse-mixing scheme. In addition, this study proposes an improved cyclic delay line to eliminate the undesirable shift in the temporal resolution successfully. Therefore, the effective resolution can be controlled completely by the pulse-mixing unit to improve accuracy. The proposed TDC composed of only one cyclic delay line and one counter is fabricated in a TSMC CMOS 0.35-mu m DPQM process. The chip core occupies an extremely small area of 0.02 mm(2), which is the best among the related works. The experimental result shows that an effective resolution of around 53 ps within +/- 13% variation over a 0-100 degrees C temperature range is achieved. The power consumption is 90 mu W at a sample rate of 1000 samples/s. In addition to the reduced area, the proposed TDC circuit achieves its resolution with less thermal-sensitivity and better fluctuations caused by process variations.

University students usually overestimate peer alcohol use, resulting in them 'drinking up' to perceived norms. Social norms theory suggests correcting these inflated perceptions can reduce alcohol consumption. Recent findings by the current authors show portraying oneself as 'a drinker' is considered by many students to be a socially desirable component of their Facebook identity, perpetuating an online culture that normalises binge drinking. However, social networking sites have yet to be utilised in social norms interventions. Design and Methods. Actual and perceived descriptive and injunctive drinking norms were collected from 244 university students. Ninety-five students screened positive for hazardous drinking and were randomly allocated to a control group or intervention group that received social norms feedback via personalised Facebook private messages over three sessions. Results. At 1 month post-intervention, the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumed by intervention group during the previous month had significantly reduced compared with baseline and controls. Reductions were maintained 3 months post-intervention. Intervention group perceived drinking norms were significantly more accurate post-intervention. Discussion and Conclusions. This is the first study to test the feasibility of using Facebook to deliver social norms interventions. Correcting misperceptions of peer drinking norms resulted in clinically significant reductions in alcohol use. Facebook has many advantages over traditional social norms delivery, providing an innovative method for tackling problem drinking at university. These results have implications for the use of Facebook to deliver positive messages about safe alcohol use to students, which may counter the negative messages regarding alcohol normally seen on Facebook.","[Ridout, Brad; Campbell, Andrew] Univ Sydney, Fac Hlth Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia","Ridout, B (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Fac Hlth Sci, Bldg C42,POB 170, Lidcombe, NSW 1825, Australia.",brad.ridout@sydney.edu.au,"Ridout, Brad/AAD-5802-2020; Campbell, Andrew J/AAK-1559-2020","Campbell, Andrew/0000-0002-2217-2589",,,,32,55,55,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0959-5236,1465-3362,,DRUG ALCOHOL REV,Drug Alcohol Rev.,NOV,2014,33,6,,,,,667,673,,10.1111/dar.12141,,,7,Substance Abuse,Substance Abuse,AT9FA,WOS:000345232100014,24689339,Bronze,,,2020-12-18,

Parents were randomly shown an advertisement (counter-advertisement challenging FOPP/control advertisement) and then a pair of food products from the same category: an unhealthy product featuring an FOPP (nutrient content claim/sports celebrity endorsement) and a healthier control product with no FOPP. Setting: Australia. Participants: A total of 1,269 Australian-based parents of children aged 5-12 years recruited from an online panel. Main Outcome Measures: Parents nominated which product they would prefer to buy and which they thought was healthier, then rated the unhealthy product and FOPP on various characteristics. Analysis: Differences between advertisement conditions were assessed using logistic regression (product choice tasks) and analysis of variance tests (ratings of unhealthy product and FOPP). Results: Compared with parents who saw a control advertisement, parents who saw a counter-advertisement perceived unhealthy products featuring FOPPs as less healthy, expressed weaker intentions for buying such products, and were more likely to read the nutrition facts panel before nominating choices (all P < .001).

The rise of Twitter as a key venue for political journalists would seem to support their fact-checking activities. Through a content analysis of political journalists' Twitter discourse surrounding the 2012 presidential debates, this study examines the degree to which fact-checking techniques were used on Twitter and the ways in which journalists on Twitter adhered to the practices of either professional or scientific objectivity-the mode that underlies the fact-checking enterprise-or disregarded objectivity altogether. A typology of tweets indicates that fact checking played a notable but secondary role in journalists' Twitter discourse. Professional objectivity, especially simple stenography, dominated reporting practices on Twitter, and opinion and commentary were also prevalent. We determine that Twitter is indeed conducive to some elements of fact checking. But taken as a whole, our data suggest that journalists and commentators posted opinionated tweets about the candidates' claims more often than they fact checked those claims.","[Coddington, Mark; Molyneux, Logan; Lawrence, Regina G.] Univ Texas Austin, Sch Journalism, Austin, TX 78712 USA","Lawrence, RG (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Sch Journalism, 300 W Dean Keeton A1000, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",regina.lawrence@austin.utexas.edu,"Molyneux, Logan/I-9791-2019","Molyneux, Logan/0000-0001-7382-3065",,,,52,45,44,5,47,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1940-1612,1940-1620,,INT J PRESS/POLIT,Int.

To guarantee the integrity of the received GNSS signal, the receiver should either be able to function in the presence of RFI without generating misleading information (i.e., offering a navigation solution within an accuracy limit), or the receiver must detect RFI so that some other means could be used as a countermeasure in order to ensure robust and accurate navigation. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to identify; an interference occurrence and not to confuse it with other signal conditions, for example, indoor or deep urban canyon, both of which have somewhat similar impact on the navigation performance. Hence, in this paper, the objective is to investigate the effect of interference on different GNSS receiver observables in two different environments: L an interference scenario with an inexpensive car jammer, and ii. an outdoor-indoor scenario without any intentional interference. The investigated observables include the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) measurements, the digitized IF (Intermediate Frequency) signal levels, the Delay Locked Loop and the Phase Locked Loop discriminator variances, and the Carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N-0) measurements. The behavioral pattern of these receiver observables is perceived in these two different scenarios in order to comprehend which of those observables would be able to separate an interference situation from an indoor scenario, since in both the cases, the resulting positioning accuracy and/or availability are affected somewhat similarly. A new Running Digital Sum (RDS) -based interference detection method is also proposed herein that can be used as an alternate to AGC-based interference detection. It is shown in this paper that it is not at all wise to consider certain receiver observables for interference detection (i.e., C/N-0); rather it is beneficial to utilize certain specific observables, such as the RDS of raw digitized signal levels or the AGC-based observables that can uniquely identify a critical malicious' interference occurrence.","[Bhuiyan, Mohammad Zahidul H.; Kuusniemi, Heidi; Soderholm, Stefan] Finnish Geodet Inst, Dept Nav & Positioning, Kyrkslatt, Finland; [Airos, Esa] Def Forces Tech Res Ctr, Riihimaki, Finland","Bhuiyan, MZH (corresponding author), Finnish Geodet Inst, Dept Nav & Positioning, Kyrkslatt, Finland.",zahidul.bhuiyan@fgi.fi; heidi.kuusniemi@fgi.fi; stefan.soderholm@fgi.fi; esa.airos@mil.fi,"Lohan, Elena Simona/L-5449-2013","Lohan, Elena Simona/0000-0003-1718-6924","Scientific Advisory Board for Defense of the Finnish Ministry of Defense; Finnish Geodetic Institute, Finland","This research has been conducted within the project DETERJAM (Detection, analysis, and risk management of satellite navigation jamming) funded by the Scientific Advisory Board for Defense of the Finnish Ministry of Defense and the Finnish Geodetic Institute, Finland.",,16,11,12,0,6,SPOLECNOST PRO RADIOELEKTRONICKE INZENYRSTVI,PRAHA,"CZECH TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY, DEPT OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD, TECHNICKA 2, PRAHA, CZ-16627, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-2512,,,RADIOENGINEERING,Radioengineering,SEP,2014,23,3,,,,,898,906,,,,,9,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Engineering,AQ1DU,WOS:000342522900018,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020-12-18,

Students were asked to participate in voluntary screening of health behaviors upon arrival at SHS. One hundred and twenty-three students who used marijuana at least monthly completed assessments and were randomized to one of four intervention conditions in a 2 (intervention: Marijuana eCHECKUP TO GO vs. control) x 2 (site of intervention: on-site vs. off-site) between-groups design. Follow-up assessments were conducted online at 3 and 6 months. Latent growth modeling was used to provide effect size estimates for the influence of intervention on outcomes. One thousand and eighty undergraduate students completed screening. The intervention did not influence marijuana use frequency. However, there was evidence of a small overall intervention effect on marijuana-related consequences and a medium effect in stratified analyses in the on-site condition. Analyses of psychological variables showed that the intervention significantly reduced perceived norms regarding peer marijuana use. These findings demonstrate that it is feasible to identify marijuana users in SHS and deliver an automated web-based intervention to these students in different contexts. Effect size estimates suggest that the intervention has some promise as a means of correcting misperceptions of marijuana use norms and reducing marijuana-related consequences. Future work should test the efficacy of this intervention in a full scale randomized controlled trial. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

US students overestimate how much their peers drink and correcting this through the use of social norm messages may promote responsible drinking. Objectives: We tested whether there is an association between perceived campus drinking norms and usual drinking behavior in UK university students and whether norm messages about responsible drinking correct normative misperceptions and increase students' intentions to drink responsibly. Method: 1,020 UK university students took part in an online study. Participants were exposed to one of five message types: a descriptive norm, an injunctive norm, a descriptive and injunctive norm, or one of two control messages. Message credibility was assessed. Afterwards participants completed measures of intentions to drink responsibly and we measured usual drinking habits and perceptions of peer drinking. Results: Perceptions of peer drinking were associated modestly with usual drinking behavior, whereby participants who believed other students drank responsibly also drank responsibly. Norm messages changed normative perceptions, but not in the target population of participants who underestimated responsible drinking in their peers at baseline. Norm messages did not increase intentions to drink responsibly and although based on accurate data, norm messages were not seen as credible. Conclusions: In this UK based study, although perceived social norms about peer drinking were associated with individual differences in drinking habits, campus wide norm messages about responsible drinking did not affect students' intentions to drink more responsibly. More research is required to determine if this approach can be applied to UK settings.","[Robinson, Eric; Jones, Andrew; Christiansen, Paul; Field, Matt] Univ Liverpool, Dept Psychol Sci, UK Ctr Tobacco & Alcohol Studies, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England","Robinson, E (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Eleanor Rathbone Bldg, Liverpool L69 7ZA, Merseyside, England.",eric.robinson@liv.ac.uk,"Field, Matt/AAQ-1056-2020","Field, Matt/0000-0002-7790-5559",Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/K023195/1] Funding Source: Medline; Medical Research CouncilMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MR/K023195/1B] Funding Source: researchfish,,,32,10,10,0,31,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1082-6084,1532-2491,,SUBST USE MISUSE,Subst.

Food safety professionals play an important role in protecting the public from foodborne illness. A survey of food safety professionals (n = 314) was conducted to characterize their knowledge of NoVs and to identify gaps in this knowledge. To recruit individuals, 25 professional organizations promoted the survey via their Web sites, newsletters, and/or e-mail distribution lists. The survey used true or false and open-ended questions to assess knowledge about NoVs, including attribution, transmission, and prevention and control strategies, including food handling practices. The online survey was available from mid-October 2012 to mid-January 2013. Of the 314 respondents, 66.2% correctly identified NoVs as one of the three most common causes of foodborne disease in the United States. Only 5.4% of respondents correctly identified the three most common settings for NoV infections, and 65.0% of respondents had the misperception that cruise ships are one of the three most common settings. Seventeen respondents (5.4%) answered all 20 true-or-false questions correctly, 33 respondents (10.5%) answered at least 19 of the 20 questions correctly, and 186 respondents (65.0%) answered at least 15 of the 20 questions correctly (i.e., a score of 75% or higher). The. content domain in which respondents had the most incorrect answers was food handling practices. Thirty-eight percent of respondents incorrectly responded that it is safe for restaurant workers infected with NoVs to handle packaged food, food equipment, and utensils. About half of respondents did not know the recommended sanitizing solution for eliminating NoVs from a contaminated surface: The survey findings identified several important gaps in food safety professionals' knowledge of NoVs. The study results will inform the development of a Web-based educational module on NoVs to improve efforts to prevent the spread of NoVs in retail and institutional food establishments.","[Kosa, Katherine M.; Cates, Sheryl C.; Brophy, Jenna E.] RTI Int, Food & Nutr Policy Res, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Hall, Aron J.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Viral Dis, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; [Fraser, Angela] Clemson Univ, Dept Food Nutr & Packaging Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA","Kosa, KM (corresponding author), RTI Int, Food & Nutr Policy Res, 3040 East Cornwallis Rd,POB 12194, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",kkosa@rti.org,,,"Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant from the USDA, National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-68003-30395]","This research was funded in part through a grant from the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant No. 2011-68003-30395 from the USDA, National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

The aim of the present study was to introduce the application of a digital occlusal splint (DOS) in the assistance of CCG to treat ankylosis and mandibular deviation simultaneously. Materials and Methods: We designed and implemented a retrospective cohort study and enrolled a sample of growing pediatric patients with unilateral TMJ ankylosis and mandibular deviation who were treated for CCG at our department. The predictor variable was preoperative three-dimensional treatment planning and splint construction (DOS) compared with intraoperative treatment planning and splint fabrication (conventional occlusal splint [COS]). The primary outcome variables were the postoperative ramus height and chin deviation correction measured using Proplan CMF, version 1.3 software. The secondary outcome variable was the treatment time. Data from the 2 methods were compared using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software package, version 13.0. Results: A total of 8 children, 4 with a COS and 4 with a DOS were included in the present study. The treatment time was significantly longer in the COS group (mean 9.625 hours) than in the DOS group (mean 6.75 hours). The ramus height and chin deviation correction after surgery were more accurate in the DOS group (mean 2.09 mm and 1.29 degrees, respectively) than in the COS group (mean 5.44 mm and 3.27 degrees, respectively), but without significance (P > .05). Conclusions: The preoperative fabrication of DOSs compared with the intraoperative fabrication of COSs resulted in a shorter treatment time and improved mandibular deviation correction in the treatment of children with unilateral TMJ ankylosis.

Microfluidic sensors and the integration of sensors with microfluidic systems are often described as miniature versions of their macro-scale counterparts. This technology presents unique advantages for handling costly and difficult-to-obtain samples and reagents as a typical system requires between 100 nL to 10 mu L of working fluid. The fabrication of a fully functional cell-based biosensor utilizes both biological patterning and microfabrication techniques. A digital micro-mirror (photolithographic) system is initiated to construct the tissue platform while a cell printer is used to precisely embed the cells within the construct. Tissue construct developed with these technologies will provide an early diagnostic of a drug's potential use. A three-dimensional interconnected microfluidic environment has the potential to eliminate the limitations of the traditional mainstays of two-dimensional investigations.

This chapter discusses the role of new(er) media in facilitating the transmediated spread of extremist narratives, rumors, and political parody. Drawing from recent case studies based upon multi-modal analyses of digital texts on social media networks, including blogs, vlogs, Twitter, and Jihadist sites associated with acts of terror in Asia, Middle East, and North America, the chapter illustrates how digital transmediation significantly works oftentimes to construct counter narratives to government counter insurgency operations and mainstream. media presentations. In discussing these examples, the chapter demonstrates how the new media points to varied narratives and reifies notions of national security, global politics, terrorism, and the media's role in framing the War on Terrorism.

Carbon nanotube FETs (CNFETs) are excellent candidates for further energy reduction, as CNFET-based digital circuits are projected to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in energy-delay product compared with silicon-CMOS at highly scaled technology nodes. However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are inherently subject to imperfections and variations such as those induced by mispositioned and metallic CNTs. These substantial imperfections and variations have prevented the demonstration of complex CNFET circuits until now. This paper presents the first demonstration of a subsystem, which is a complete capacitive sensor interface circuit, implemented entirely using CNFETs that can be fabricated reproducibly in a VLSI-compatible fashion. This is made possible by: 1) a digitally oriented interface architecture and 2) the imperfection-immune design paradigm, which combines design and processing techniques to successfully overcome CNT imperfections and variations. In addition to electrical measurements, we demonstrate correct operation of our CNFET circuitry by interfacing it with a sensor used to control a handshaking robot.","[Shulaker, Max M.; Hills, Gage; Wei, Hai; Chen, Hong-Yu; Wong, H. -S.

In order to satisfy the severe requirement of a wide range operating temperature under the given constraints, the ADC was simplified by eliminating nonessential building blocks such as reference drivers, a sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA), and level shifters. The proposed internal signal amplification method extends the effective signal range in both multiplying digital-to-analog converter and flash ADC, as well as the error correction range. A new clock generation circuit for a SHA-less pipelined ADC removes the need for a higher frequency external clock. The prototype ADC was fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process. The ADC core consumes 23.4 mW at 3.3-V/1.8-V supplies. The measured worst differential nonlinearity and integral nonlinearity were -0.52/+0.7 LSB and -0.86/+0.9 LSB, respectively, at a temperature of -40 degrees C. The signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio stayed above 55 dB in the Nyquist condition in a temperature range of -40 degrees C-125 degrees C, which is about a 0.5 effective-number-of-bits drop from the room-temperature result.","[Oh, Ghil-Geun; Lee, Chang-Kyo; Ryu, Seung-Tak] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea","Oh, GG (corresponding author), Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Taejon 305701, South Korea.",ggoh@kaist.ac.kr; ck_lee@kaist.ac.kr; stryu@kaist.ac.kr,"Ryu, Seung-Tak/C-1787-2011",,"Center for Integrated Smart Sensors as Global Frontier Project [CISS-2012M3A6A6054202]; National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [2012R1A2A2A01047062]; Korean Government Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning ( MSIP)","This work was supported in part by the Center for Integrated Smart Sensors as Global Frontier Project under Grant CISS-2012M3A6A6054202, and by the National Research Foundation of Korea under Grant 2012R1A2A2A01047062 funded by the Korean Government Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning ( MSIP).

Numerous models have been devised to describe this process, including epidemic models and spin models, which mainly focus on how opinions spread and interact with each other, respectively. In this paper, we propose a model that combines the spreading stage and the interaction stage for opinions to illustrate the process of dispelling a rumor. Moreover, we set up authoritative nodes, which disseminate positive opinion to counterbalance the negative opinion prevailing on online social networking sites. With analysis of the relationship among positive opinion proportion, opinion strength and the density of authoritative nodes in networks with different topologies, we demonstrate that the positive opinion proportion grows with the density of authoritative nodes until the positive opinion prevails in the entire network. In particular, the relationship is linear in homogeneous topologies. Besides, it is also noteworthy that initial locations of the negative opinion source and authoritative nodes do not influence positive opinion proportion in homogeneous networks but have a significant impact on heterogeneous networks. The results are verified by numerical simulations and are helpful to understand the mechanism of two different opinions interacting with each other on online social networking sites.

At the current state of the art, quantum bits (qubits) are fabricated, initialized, controlled, read out and coupled to each other in simple circuits. This enables the realization of basic logic gates(4), the creation of complex entangled states(5,6) and the demonstration of algorithms(7) or error correction(8). Using different variants of low-noise parametric amplifiers(9), dispersive quantum non-demolition single-shot readout of single-qubit states with high fidelity has enabled continuous(10) and discrete(11) feedback control of single qubits. Here we realize full deterministic quantum teleportation with feed-forward in a chip-based superconducting circuit architecture(12-14). We use a set of two parametric amplifiers for both joint two-qubit and individual qubit single-shot readout, combined with flexible real-time digital electronics. Our device uses a crossed quantum bus technology that allows us to create complex networks with arbitrary connecting topology in a planar architecture. The deterministic teleportation process succeeds with order unit probability for any input state, as we prepare maximally entangled two-qubit states as a resource and distinguish all Bell states in a single two-qubit measurement with high efficiency and high fidelity. We teleport quantum states between two macroscopic systems separated by 6 mm at a rate of 10(4) s(-1), exceeding other reported implementations. The low transmission loss of superconducting waveguides is likely to enable the range of this and other schemes to be extended to significantly larger distances, enabling tests of non-locality and the realization of elements for quantum communication at microwave frequencies. The demonstrated feed-forward may also find application in error correction schemes.","[Steffen, L.; Salathe, Y.; Oppliger, M.; Kurpiers, P.; Baur, M.; Lang, C.; Eichler, C.; Puebla-Hellmann, G.; Fedorov, A.; Wallraff, A.] ETH, Dept Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland","Steffen, L (corresponding author), ETH, Dept Phys, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",lsteffen@phys.ethz.ch; andreas.wallraff@phys.ethz.ch,"Eichler, Christopher/AAU-1816-2020; Wallraff, Andreas/C-2130-2009; Fedorov, Arkady/F-4764-2012","Wallraff, Andreas/0000-0002-3476-4485; Fedorov, Arkady/0000-0002-9815-0968",Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich (ETH Zurich); EU Integrated Project SOLID; EU Integrated Project SCALEQIT; Swiss National Science Foundation's National Centre of Competence in Research 'Quantum Science Technology',"We thank A.

Speed and function density of FPGAs are increasing as transistor sizes shrink to the nanoscale. As these transistors reduce in size intrinsic variability becomes more of a problem and to reliably create electronic designs according to specification time consuming statistical simulations become necessary; and even with accurate models and statistical simulation, the fabrication yield will decrease as every physical instance of a design behaves differently. This paper describes an adaptive, evolvable architecture that allows for correction and optimization of circuits directly in hardware using bioinspired techniques. Similar to FPGAs, the programmable analog and digital array (PAnDA) architecture introduced provides a digital configuration layer for circuit design. Accessing additional configuration options of the underlying analog layer enables continuous adjustment of circuit characteristics at runtime, which enables dynamic optimization of the mapped design's performance. Moreover, the yield of devices can be improved postfabrication via reconfiguration of the analog layer, which can overcome faults induced due to variability and process defects. Since optimization goals are generic, i.e., not restricted to reducing stochastic variability, power consumption or increasing speed, the same mechanisms can also enhance the device's fault tolerant abilities in the case of component degradation and failures during its lifetime or when exposed to hazardous environments.","[Walker, James Alfred; Trefzer, Martin A.; Bale, Simon J.; Tyrrell, Andy M.] Univ York, Dept Elect, Intelligent Syst Grp, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England","Walker, JA (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Elect, Intelligent Syst Grp, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",james.walker@york.ac.uk; martin.trefzer@york.ac.uk; simon.bale@york.ac.uk; andy.tyrrell@york.ac.uk,,,EPSRCEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/I005838/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/I005838/1] Funding Source: researchfish,This work was part of the PAnDA project that was funded by EPSRC (EP/I005838/1) and was the subject of a UK patent application (GB1119099.8).

The existing analyses of CSR in the alcohol industry point to the misleading nature of these CSR practices. Yet, research has been relatively sparse on how the alcohol industry advances CSR in an attempt to facilitate underlying business interests, and in what ways the ongoing display of industry CSR impacts public health. This paper aims to investigate the alcohol industry's recent CSR engagements and explain how CSR forms part of the industry's wider political and corporate strategies. Methods: Our study used qualitative methods to collect and analyse data. We searched for materials pertaining to CSR activities from websites of three transnational alcohol corporations, social media platforms, media reports and other sources. Relevant documents were thematically analysed with an iterative approach. Results: Our analysis identified three CSR tactics employed by the alcohol companies which are closely tied in with the industry's underlying corporate intents. First, the alcohol manufacturers employ CSR as a means to frame issues, define problems and guide policy debates. In doing this, the alcohol companies are able to deflect and shift the blame from those who manufacture and promote alcoholic products to those who consume them. Second, the alcohol corporations promote CSR initiatives on voluntary regulation in order to delay and offset alcohol control legislation. Third, the alcohol corporations undertake philanthropic sponsorships as a means of indirect brand marketing as well as gaining preferential access to emerging alcohol markets. Conclusions: The increasing penetration and involvement of the alcohol industry into CSR highlights the urgent needs for public health counter actions. Implementation of any alcohol control measures should include banning or restricting the publicity efforts of the industry's CSR and informing the public of the alcohol industry's notion of social responsibility. More significantly, an internationally binding instrument should be called for to enable countries to differentiate between genuine concerns and spurious altruism, and in doing so, resist the industry's attempt to erode alcohol control.","[Yoon, Sungwon] Univ Hong Kong, Li Ka Shing Fac Med, Dept Community Med, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; Univ Hong Kong, Li Ka Shing Fac Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Yoon, S (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Li Ka Shing Fac Med, Dept Community Med, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",swyoon@hku.hk,"Lam, Tai Hing/C-4317-2009","Lam, Tai Hing/0000-0002-2033-9971",,,,75,41,42,4,75,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1471-2458,,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,BMC Public Health,JUL 3,2013,13,,,,,,,,630,10.1186/1471-2458-13-630,,,11,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",178MB,WOS:000321451000001,23822724,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020-12-18,

We analyzed the source, content and accuracy of I BD videos found on YouTube (R) - one of the most popular websites in the United States - and assessed the demographic variables of the viewers. Methods: The 100 most viewed videos with relevant information on IBD were analyzed. We included only English language videos that were less than 20 min in length and primarily focused on IBD. Those with no sound/poor sound quality were excluded. More than 30 variables were analyzed. Results: Adults of 45-54 years old (95.1%) comprised the most common age group of viewers. Forty-eight percent of videos focused on Crohn's disease (CD), 32.0% on ulcerative colitis (UC), and 20.0% on both. Overall content for patient education was poor. Videos discussing alternative treatment options were more likely to depict patients personal experience (73.9% vs. 2.4%) (p<0.001) and be an advertisement compared to patient education videos (78.3% vs. 0) (p<0.001). Videos discussing patient education had a higher number of favorites (mean 25.0 vs. 5.5) (p<0.001), comments (mean 22.0 vs. 5.0) (p<0.022) and likes (mean 19.0 vs. 9.0) (p =0.025) than the ones discussing alternative treatment options. Conclusions: YouTube (R) videos on IBD are popular but a poor source of patient education.

Strangely, despite the well-recognized importance of antioxidants, currently there is no international standard index for labeling owing to the lack of standardized methods for antioxidant measurement in complex products. Here, an online high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based method to detect and measure the total antioxidant capacity of antioxidant samples is presented. In this approach, complex samples containing antioxidants are separated by the HPLC system, which is further coupled to an antioxidant measuring system consisting of an optical oxygen sensor, laccase, and tetramethoxy azobismethylene quinone (TMAMQ). The antioxidants, separated via HPLC, reduce TMAMQ to syringaldazine, which is then reoxidized by laccase while simultaneously consuming O-2. The amount of consumed oxygen is directly proportional to the concentration of antioxidants and is measured by the optical oxygen sensor. The sensor is fabricated by coating a glass capillary with an oxygen-sensitive thin layer made of platinum(II) meso-tetra(4-fluorophenyl)tetrabenzoporphyrin and polystyrene, which makes real-time analysis possible (t (90) = 1.1 s in solution). Four selected antioxidants (3 mM), namely, catechin, ferulic acid, naringenin (used as a control), and Trolox, representing flavonol, hydrocinnamic acid, flavanone, and vitamin E, respectively, were injected into the online antioxidant monitoring system, separated, and then mixed with the TMAMQ/laccase solution, which resulted in oxygen consumption. This study shows that, with the use of such a system, the antioxidant activity of individual antioxidant molecules in a sample and their contribution to the total antioxidant activity of the sample can be correctly assigned.","[Quaranta, Michela; Koren, Klaus; Klimant, Ingo] Inst Analyt Chem & Food Chem, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Prasetyo, Endry Nugroho; Nyanhongo, Gibson S.; Guebitz, Georg M.] Inst Environm Biotechnol, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Murkovic, Michael] Inst Biochem, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Guebitz, Georg M.] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Environm Biotechnol, A-3430 Vienna, Tulln, Austria","Prasetyo, EN (corresponding author), Inst Environm Biotechnol, Petersgasse 12-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",nugrohoprasetyo@tugraz.at,"Koren, Klaus/A-4876-2019","Koren, Klaus/0000-0002-7537-3114; Nyanhongo, Gibson Stephen/0000-0002-5379-8971; Nugroho Prasetyo, Endry/0000-0001-9497-2465",European CommissionEuropean CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [264772 - ITN CHEBANA],Financial support from the European Commission (grant agreement number 264772 - ITN CHEBANA) is gratefully acknowledged.,,17,10,10,1,41,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1618-2642,1618-2650,,ANAL BIOANAL CHEM,Anal.

For energy effective operations, is an important parameter in any meaningful system control mechanism. Reliable and accurate on-chip voltage sensors are therefore indispensible for the power and computation management of such systems. Existing voltage sensing methods are not suitable because they usually require a stable and known reference (voltage, current, time, frequency, etc.), which is difficult to obtain in this environment. This paper describes an autonomous reference- free voltage sensor designed using an asynchronous counter powered by the charge on a capacitor and a small controller. Unlike existing methods, the voltage information is directly generated as a digital code. The sensor, fabricated in the 180 nm technology node, was tested successfully through performing measurements over the voltage range from 1.8 V down to 0.8 V.","[Ramezani, Reza; Yakovlev, Alexandre; Xia, Fei; Murphy, Julian P.; Shang, Delong] Newcastle Univ, Sch Elect Elect & Comp Engn, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Murphy, Julian P.] Queens Univ Belfast, Inst Elect Commun & Informat Technol ECIT, Belfast BT3 9DT, Antrim, North Ireland","Ramezani, R (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Elect Elect & Comp Engn, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",reza.ramezani@ncl.ac.uk; j.p.murphy@qub.ac.uk,,"Yakovlev, Alex/0000-0003-0826-9330","EPSRC through the Holistic [EP/G066728/1]; TRAMS-2 [EP/J008133/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilEngineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/G066728/1, EP/J006238/1, EP/G034303/1, EP/K004379/1, EP/H049606/1, EP/J008133/1, EP/J005177/1] Funding Source: researchfish",This work was supported by the EPSRC through the Holistic (EP/G066728/1) and TRAMS-2 (EP/J008133/1) projects.

Large-quantity synthesis of CuSNTs was accomplished via a solution-based sacrificial template method under moderate conditions, while ITO Schottky contacts were fabricated via micro-fabrication and pulsed laser deposition (PLD). Upon light illumination, CuSNTs-ITO Schottky junctions exhibited pronounced photovoltaic behavior, giving rise to a power conversion efficiency of 1.17% on a conventional SiO2/Si substrate. Furthermore, by utilizing PET as the substrate, transparent and flexible CuSNTs-ITO solar cells were constructed and showed performance close to their device counterparts on a rigid substrate. Notably, it was found that the flexible devices were robust against tensile strain and could stand a bending angle up to similar to 95 degrees. To enhance the light absorption of the devices, an Ag mirror layer was deposited on the rear side of the PET substrate so as to allow multiple reflection and absorption of the incident light. As a result, the flexible devices showed a substantial performance improvement, yielding an efficiency of similar to 2%. Our results demonstrate that low-cost and environmentally friendly CuSNTs-ITO solar cells are promising candidates for new-generation photovoltaic devices.

Results: Significant misperceptions exist among students regarding their perception of the drinking patterns and behaviors displayed by peers in general and during celebration events. Overestimation is more prevalent for celebration drinking than for drinking in general. The odds of being an overestimator are greater for out-of-state residents, frequent drinkers, and students with lower GPAs.

Consequently, much of the health-related information and advice available online is inaccurate and/or misleading. Scores of medical institution Web sites are for organizations that do not exist and more than 90% of online pharmacy Web sites are fraudulent. In addition to monetary losses exacted on unsuspecting users, these fake medical Web sites have severe public safety ramifications. According to a World Health Organization report, approximately half the drugs sold on the Web are counterfeit, resulting in thousands of deaths. In this study, we propose an adaptive learning algorithm called recursive trust labeling (RTL). RTL uses underlying content and graph-based classifiers, coupled with a recursive labeling mechanism, for enhanced detection of fake medical Web sites. The proposed method was evaluated on a test bed encompassing nearly 100 million links between 930,000 Web sites, including 1,000 known legitimate and fake medical sites. The experimental results revealed that RTL was able to significantly improve fake medical Web site detection performance over 19 comparison content and graph-based methods, various meta-learning techniques, and existing adaptive learning approaches, with an overall accuracy of over 94%. Moreover, RTL was able to attain high performance levels even when the training dataset composed of as little as 30 Web sites. With the increased popularity of eHealth and Health 2.0, the results have important implications for online trust, security, and public safety.","[Abbasi, Ahmed] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Zahedi, Fatemeh Mariam] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI USA; [Kaza, Siddharth] Towson Univ, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Towson, MD USA","Abbasi, A (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",abbasi@comm.virginia.edu,,,National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CNS-1049497],"This work is supported by the National Science Foundation, under grant CNS-1049497.",,76,12,12,2,38,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA",1046-8188,1558-2868,,ACM T INFORM SYST,ACM Trans.

Correcting misperceptions by providing feedback has been shown to be an effective intervention for reducing licit drug use. It is currently unknown if social norms interventions are effective in preventing and reducing illicit drug use in European students. The purpose of this paper is to describe the design of a multi-site cluster controlled trial of a web-based social norms intervention aimed at reducing licit and preventing illicit drug use in European university students. Methods/Design: An online questionnaire to assess rates of drug use will be developed and translated based on existing social norms surveys. Students from sixteen universities in seven participating European countries will be invited to complete the questionnaire. Both intervention and control sites will be chosen by convenience. In each country, the intervention site will be the university that the local principal investigator is affiliated with. We aim to recruit 1000 students per site (baseline assessment). All participants will complete the online questionnaire at baseline. Baseline data will be used to develop social norms messages that will be included in a web-based intervention. The intervention group will receive individualized social norms feedback. The website will remain online during the following 5 months. After five months, a second survey will be conducted and effects of the intervention on social norms and drug use will be measured in comparison to the control site. Discussion: This project is the first cross-national European collaboration to investigate the feasibility of a social norms intervention to reduce licit and prevent illicit drug use among European university students.","[Pischke, Claudia R.; Zeeb, Hajo; Helmer, Stefanie M.; Mikolajczyk, Rafael T.] BIPS Inst Epidemiol & Prevent Res, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [van Hal, Guido; Vriesacker, Bart] Univ Antwerp, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium; [McAlaney, John] Univ Bradford, Div Psychol, Bradford BD7 1DP, W Yorkshire, England; [Bewick, Bridgette M.] Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Akvardar, Yildiz] Marmara Univ, Sch Med, Istanbul, Turkey; [Guillen-Grima, Francisco] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Hlth Sci, Navarra, Spain; [Orosova, Olga; Salonna, Ferdinand; Kalina, Ondrej] PJ Safaric Univ, Dept Educ Psychol & Hlth Psychol, Kosice, Slovakia; [Stock, Christiane] Univ So Denmark, Inst Publ Hlth, Esbjerg, Denmark; [Mikolajczyk, Rafael T.] Helmholtz Ctr Infect Res, Braunschweig, Germany; [Mikolajczyk, Rafael T.] Hannover Med Sch, Hannover, Germany","Pischke, CR (corresponding author), BIPS Inst Epidemiol & Prevent Res, Achterstr 30, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",pischke@bips.uni-bremen.de,"Guillen-Grima, Francisco/H-3359-2012; Zeeb, Hajo/I-2701-2019; Salonna, Ferdinand/G-2525-2017; AKVARDAR, YILDIZ/AAC-9910-2020; Van Hal, Guido F/B-5948-2017; Stock, Christiane/P-8114-2015","Guillen-Grima, Francisco/0000-0001-9749-8076; Zeeb, Hajo/0000-0001-7509-242X; Salonna, Ferdinand/0000-0002-1597-5770; Van Hal, Guido F/0000-0002-4611-4076; McAlaney, John/0000-0003-4062-6131; Mikolajczyk, Rafael/0000-0003-1271-7204; Stock, Christiane/0000-0001-9379-3844; Bewick, Bridgette/0000-0001-5752-5623","European Research Advisory Board; European Commission, Directorate General Justice, Freedom and Security [JLS/2009-2010/DPIP/AG]","The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

The method relies on using a parameterized behavioral model implemented on FPGA, whose parameters values are adaptively tuned, based on the response to test pseudo-random actuation of the physical structure. Dedicated comb drives actuate the movable mass with binary maximum length pseudo-random sequences of small amplitude, to keep the device within the linear operating regime. The frequency of the stimulus is chosen within the mechanical spectral operating range of the micro-device, such that the induced response leads to the identification of the mechanical transfer function, and to the tuning of the associated digital behavioral model. In case of a micro-gyroscope, experimental results demonstrate the adaptive tracking of the damping coefficient from 5.57 x 10(-5) Kg/s to 7.12 x 10(-5) Kg/s and of the stiffness coefficient from 132 N/m to 137.7 N/m. In the case of a MEMS accelerometer, the damping and stiffness coefficients are correctly tracked from 3.4 x 10(-3) Kg/s and 49.56 N/m to 4.57 x 10(-3) Kg/s and 51.48 N/m, respectively-the former values are designer-specified target values, while the latter are experimentally measured parameters for fabricated devices operating in a real environment. Hardware resources estimation confirms the small area the proposed algorithm occupies on the targeted FPGA device.","[Sarraf, Elie H.; Sharma, Mrigank; Cretu, Edmond] Univ British Columbia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Kansal, Ankit] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Delhi, India","Sarraf, EH (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",sarrafe@ece.ubc.ca; kansankit@gmail.com; mriganks@ece.ubc.ca; edmondc@ece.ubc.ca,,,,,,16,2,2,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0923-8174,1573-0727,,J ELECTRON TEST,J.

Personalised normative feedback (PNF) aims to correct this misperception by providing information about personal drinking levels and patterns compared with norms in similar aged peer groups. PNF is intended to raise motivation for behaviour change and has been highlighted for alcohol misuse prevention by the British Government Behavioural Insight Team. The objective of the trial was to assess the effectiveness of PNF with college students for the prevention of alcohol misuse. Methodology: Solomon three-group randomised controlled trial. 1751 students, from 22 British Universities, allocated to a PNF group, a normal control group, or a delayed measurement control group to allow assessment of any measurement effects. PNF was provided by email. Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline, 6- and 12-months (only 12-months for the delayed measurement controls). Drinking behaviour measures were (i) alcohol disorders; (ii) frequency; (iii) typical quantity, (iv) weekly consumption; (v) alcohol-related problems; (vi) perceived drinking norms; and (vii) positive alcohol expectancies. Analyses focused on high-risk drinkers, as well as all students, because of research evidence for the prevention paradox in student drinkers. Principal Findings: Follow-up rates were low, with only 50% and 40% responding at 6- and 12-months, respectively, though comparable to similar European studies. We found no evidence for any systematic attrition bias. Overall, statistical analyses with the high risk sub-sample, and for all students, showed no significant effects of the intervention, at either time-point, in a completed case analysis and a multiple imputation analysis. Conclusions: We found no evidence for the effectiveness of PNF for the prevention of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems in a UK student population.","[Moreira, Maria T.] Inst Super Saude Alto Ave, Braga, Portugal; [Oskrochi, Reza] Oxford Brookes Univ, Med Stat Programme, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Foxcroft, David R.] Oxford Brookes Univ, Dept Psychol Social Work & Publ Hlth, Oxford OX3 0BP, England","Moreira, MT (corresponding author), Inst Super Saude Alto Ave, Braga, Portugal.",david.foxcroft@brookes.ac.uk,"Oskrochi, Gholamreza/R-4435-2019","Foxcroft, David/0000-0001-9752-7527",Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology; Alcohol Research UK; European Foundation for Alcohol Research; alcohol industry for prevention projects; Drinkaware Trust,"MTM was supported by a fellowship from the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology.

The mixing and segregation phenomenon occur in most systems of granular solids and have a significant influence on the quality and outcome of the final product. The usual approach to mix the powders is by using a tumbling blender which rotates around one axis, where, the radial convection is reported to be faster than axial dispersion transport, hindering the mixing performance. A double cone mixer is fabricated which rotates around two axes, causing axial mixing competitive to its radial counterpart. Samples are collected intrusively using the discrete pocket samplers to quantify the characteristics of mixing for millimeter sized glass beads. Digital video recording and MATLAB based image analysis techniques are used for non-intrusive characterization of mixing in micron sized art sands. A parametric study of the effect of particle size, vessel speeds on the granular mixing is accomplished.

The present study investigated family planning providers' attitudes and considerations when recommending family planning methods and LARCs to clients. Additionally, this study explored whether urban-rural differences exist in providers' attitudes toward LARCs and in clients' use of LARCs. Methods: Data were collected using an online survey of family planning providers at Title X clinics in Texas. Survey data was linked to family planning client data from the Family Planning Annual Report (2008). Results: Findings indicated that, although providers were aware of the advantages of LARCs, clients' LARC use remains infrequent. Providers reported that the benefits of hormone implants include their effectiveness for 3 years and that they are an option for women who cannot take estrogen-based birth control. Providers acknowledged the benefits of several types of LARCs; however, urban providers were more likely to acknowledge the benefits of hormone implants compared with their rural counterparts. Results also indicated barriers to recommending LARCs, such as providers' misinformation about LARCs and their caution in recommending LARCs to adolescents. However, findings also indicated providers lack training in LARC insertion, specifically among those practicing in rural areas. Conclusions: In light of the effectiveness and longevity of LARCs, teenagers and clients living in rural areas are ideal LARC candidates. Increased training among family planning providers, especially for those practicing in rural areas, may increase their recommendations of LARCs to clients.

Physicians and others who conduct clinical trials should be aware of this issue. Study investigators and research teams should also talk to their study subjects about where and how they are obtaining information in order to prevent behaviors and correct misinformation that could put a subject's safety or the study objectives at risk.

J,"Parkash, S",,,,"Parkash, Surya",,,Ethics in disaster management,ANNALS OF GEOPHYSICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In any profession, a basic set of moral values needs to be followed to comply with what we call ethics. Geoscientists have significant roles to play, more particularly in the field of geohazards, to appraise society about the possibilities of natural hazards such as landslides, avalanches, floods, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Geoscientists cannot only assess these hazards, but they can also estimate the potential consequences if these hazards occur in a given place and at a given time. However, sometimes it has been found that the credibility of geoscientists among society and government is lost, due to some unethical practices for short-term gain, or due to incorrect understanding of geological phenomena. Some of the hazards that cannot be predicted with the existing capabilities have been forecast by some pseudo-geoscientists, to draw social/media attention, thereby bringing the reputation of the profession into disrepute. There is the need to be fair enough to accept the limitations of our profession in providing information about natural hazards that are not yet fully understood by the professionals themselves. More specifically, the predictions related to earthquakes have drawn the attention of society as well as media in the developing countries where the 'common' people have different perceptions. Most often, popular myths take over scientific facts among the public, and this can lead to rumors about natural hazards. This article will mention some cases of rumors about natural disasters, and particularly earthquakes, and the response of society, media and government. It emphasizes the role of geoscientists as the ethical responsibility to inform the public about the actual situations and the geohazards, to avoid panic caused by rumors from non-specialists or hyperactive pseudo experts. This article indicates the recent rumors about a lake outburst, flash floods, and volcanic activities after a moderate earthquake (M 6.9, September 18, 2011) in the Sikkim State of India, and considers the actions taken by the geoscientific community to correctly inform people about the real situation.","Natl Inst Disaster Management, New Delhi, India","Parkash, S (corresponding author), Natl Inst Disaster Management, New Delhi, India.",suryanidm@gmail.com,,,,,,3,3,3,0,38,IST NAZIONALE DI GEOFISICA E VULCANOLOGIA,ROME,"VIA VIGNA MURATA 605, ROME, 00143, ITALY",1593-5213,,,ANN GEOPHYS-ITALY,Ann.

One can use complex network theory to optimize resource locations and optimize actions. Randomly constructed graphs and probabilistic arguments lead to important conclusions with a possible great social and financial influence. Security in online social networks has recently become a major issue for network designers and operators. Being open in their nature and offering users the ability to compose and share information, such networks may involuntarily be used as an infection platform by viruses and other kinds of malicious software. This is specifically true for mobile social networks, that allow their users to download millions of applications created by various individual programers, some of which may be malicious or flawed. In order to detect that an application is malicious, monitoring its operation in a real environment for a significant period of time is often required. As the computation and power resources of mobile devices are very limited, a single device can monitor only a limited number of potentially malicious applications locally. In this work, we propose an efficient collaborative monitoring scheme that harnesses the collective resources of many mobile devices, generating a vaccination-like effect in the network. We suggest a new local information flooding algorithm called Time-to-Live Probabilistic Propagation (TPP). The algorithm is implemented in any mobile device, periodically monitors one or more applications and reports its conclusions to a small number of other mobile devices, who then propagate this information onward, whereas each message has a predefined Time-to-Live (TTL) counter. The algorithm is analyzed, and is shown to outperform the existing state of the art information propagation algorithms, in terms of convergence time as well as network overhead. We then show both analytically and experimentally that implementing the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the number of infected mobile devices. Finally, we analytically prove that the algorithm is tolerant to the presence of adversarial agents that inject false information into the system.","[Altshuler, Yaniv; Elovici, Yuval] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Informat Syst Engn, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Altshuler, Yaniv; Elovici, Yuval] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Deutsch Telekom Labs, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Altshuler, Yaniv] MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Dolev, Shlomi] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Comp Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel","Altshuler, Y (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Informat Syst Engn, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",yanival@mit.edu; dolev@bgu.ac.il; elovici@bgu.ac.il,,,,,,67,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1931-6828,,978-1-4614-0753-9,SPRINGER SER OPTIM A,,,2012,57,,,,,,507,538,,10.1007/978-1-4614-0754-6_17,10.1007/978-1-4614-0754-6,,32,"Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied; Telecommunications",Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Telecommunications,BYU16,WOS:000300341200017,,,,,2020-12-18,

Though these so-called neuromyths are loosely based on scientific facts, they may have adverse effects on educational practice. The present study investigated the prevalence and predictors of neuromyths among teachers in selected regions in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. A large observational survey design was used to assess general knowledge of the brain and neuromyths. The sample comprised 242 primary and secondary school teachers who were interested in the neuroscience of learning. It would be of concern if neuromyths were found in this sample, as these teachers may want to use these incorrect interpretations of neuroscience findings in their teaching practice. Participants completed an online survey containing 32 statements about the brain and its influence on learning, of which 15 were neuromyths. Additional data was collected regarding background variables (e.g., age, sex, school type). Results showed that on average, teachers believed 49% of the neuromyths, particularly myths related to commercialized educational programs. Around 70% of the general knowledge statements were answered correctly. Teachers who read popular science magazines achieved higher scores on general knowledge questions. More general knowledge also predicted an increased belief in neuromyths. These findings suggest that teachers who are enthusiastic about the possible application of neuroscience findings in the classroom find it difficult to distinguish pseudoscience from scientific facts. Possessing greater general knowledge about the brain does not appear to protect teachers from believing in neuromyths. This demonstrates the need for enhanced interdisciplinary communication to reduce such misunderstandings in the future and establish a successful collaboration between neuroscience and education.","[Dekker, Sanne; Lee, Nikki C.; Jolles, Jelle] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Educ Neurosci, Fac Psychol & Educ, LEARNI Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Howard-Jones, Paul] Univ Bristol, Grad Sch Educ, Bristol, Avon, England","Dekker, S (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Educ Neurosci, Fac Psychol & Educ, Prof EM Meijerslaan 2, NL-1183 AV Amstelveen, Netherlands.",s.j.dekker@vu.nl,,"Lee, Nikki/0000-0001-9135-4821",,,,31,137,140,9,99,FRONTIERS RESEARCH FOUNDATION,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 110, LAUSANNE, 1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Compared with bulky Geiger-Muller-type proportional counters, semiconductor-based radiation detectors, particularly those using compound semiconductors, have drawn considerable recent interest due to their scope for miniaturization. CdS is a highly sensitive II-VI compound semiconductor whose internal resistance changes on exposure to X-rays and is capable of absorbing green light in the range of 2.5 - 3.5 eV (490 - 511 nm). Despite its slow response compared with amorphous selenium, it has several advantages for digital radiography because of its low voltage requirements, high X-ray sensitivity, and high absorption coefficient. In this study, the X-ray detection characteristics of a CdS photocell were evaluated for use in an economical, portable X-ray dosimeter. A CdS photocell with a thickness of 20 mu m was fabricated by using thermal evaporation, and the ratio of its photocurrent to its dark current was found to be on the order of 105 with a maximum allowed power consumption of over 80 mW. The cell was incorporated into a prototype X-ray dosimeter system with an 8051 microprocessor, used to measure the output voltage characteristics of the CdS cell for various tube voltages, tube currents, and exposure times. The experimental results confirmed good linearity with tube voltage and current, but a delayed response. The results of this study can be used as the his for the design of accurate, economical, and portable X-ray dosimeters.","[Park, Ji-Koon; Choi, Il-Hong; Noh, Si-Cheol; Kang, Sang-Sik] Int Univ Korea, Dept Radiol Sci, Jinju 641120, South Korea; [Kim, Hyun-Hee] Int Univ Korea, Dept Disaster Prevent Engn, Jinju 641120, South Korea; [Choi, Heung-Ho; Nam, Sang-Hee] Inje Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Gimhae 621749, South Korea","Park, JK (corresponding author), Int Univ Korea, Dept Radiol Sci, Jinju 641120, South Korea.",kss94@iuk.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation [2009-0088856],This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation (2009-0088856).,,5,0,0,0,2,KOREAN PHYSICAL SOC,SEOUL,"635-4, YUKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-KU, SEOUL 135-703, SOUTH KOREA",0374-4884,,,J KOREAN PHYS SOC,J.

In this study, we examined whether providing information that counters these concerns might impact on intentions to use NRT. Participants: 900 smokers recruited from a market research database. Design and setting: Participants completed an online survey that asked about their views about NRT. Smokers with safety and efficacy concerns were queried to determine whether accurate information might increase their interest in using NRT. Findings: Misperceptions of NRT safety were common: 93% of smokers did not know that smoking while wearing the nicotine patch does not cause heart attacks; 76% that nicotine gum/lozenge are not as addictive as cigarettes; and 69% that NRT products are not as dangerous as cigarettes. Over half of the smokers with misperceptions reported that they would be more likely to use NRT to help them quit smoking if they were exposed to information correcting their concerns (53%, 58% and 66%, respectively, for each of the misperceptions). Conclusions: These data suggest that while a sizeable proportion of smokers are still misinformed about the safety of NRT, misinformed smokers would increase consideration of NRT if these misperceptions are addressed by corrective information.

SCD routinely manufactures both analog and digital InSb FPAs with array formats of 320x256, 480x384, and 640x512 elements, and pitch size in the range 15 to 30 mu m. These FPAs are available in many packaging configurations, including fully integrated detector-Dewarcooler-assembly, with either closed-cycle Stirling or open-loop Joule-Thomson coolers. In response to a need for very high resolution midwave IR (MWIR) detectors and systems, SCD has developed a large format 2D InSb detector with 1280x1024 elements and pixel size of 15 mu m. A digital readout integrated circuit (ROIC) is coupled by flip-chip bonding to the megapixel InSb array. The ROIC is fabricated in CMOS 0.18-mu m technology, that enables the small pixel circuitry and relatively low power generation at the focal plane. The digital ROIC has an analog to digital (A/D) converter per-channel and allows for full frame readout at a rate of 100 Hz. Such on-chip A/D conversion eliminates the need for several A/D converters with fairly high power consumption at the system level. The digital readout, together with the InSb detector technology, lead to a wide linear dynamic range and low residual nonuniformity, which is stable over a long period of time following a nonuniformity correction procedure. A special Dewar was designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions while minimizing the contribution to the heat load of the detector. The Dewar together with the low power ROIC, enable a megapixel detector with overall low size, weight, and power with respect to comparable large format detectors. A variety of applications with this detector make use of different cold shields with different f-number and spectral filters. In this paper we present actual performance characteristics of the megapixel InSb detector and demonstrate its high manufacturability.

Through a content analysis carried out at the discussion forums, the study showed that though authorities are highly trusted in general in Finland, this trust is not extended to the online environment. Online, civilians did not trust authorities and the protective actions taken. Moreover, the authorities' intervention to the discussion forums aimed at correcting false information and shaping opinions seemed to fail, as the intervention was carried out too late and with too little resources.

Since the imaging detectors are fabricated by semiconductor manufacturing process over large areas, defective pixels in the detectors are unavoidable. Moreover, the radiation damage due to the routine use of the detectors progressively increases the density of defective pixels. In this study, we present a method of identifying defective pixels in digital radiography detectors based on wavelet analysis. Artifacts generated due to wavelet transformations have been prevented by an additional local threshold method. The proposed method was applied to a sample digital radiography and the result was promising. The proposed method uses a single pair of dark and white images and does not require them to be corrected in gain-and-offset properties. This method will be helpful for the reliable use of digital radiography detectors through the working lifetime. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Techniques based on the direct observation of the pore system (optical and scanning electron microscopes, digital image analysis) were combined with others used for indirect characterization (mercury intrusion porosimetry, N-2 adsorption, hydric tests, and vapour permeability). In addition, we performed accelerated decay tests to determine the durability of the stones and to check the consistency of the results obtained in the pore system study. Digital image analysis allowed us to calculate the pore size distribution and the total porosity. Digital image analysis always gave higher values for total porosity than those determined by porosimetry and hydric tests, which only measure open porosity. The density values were congruent with the mineralogy of the stones. The stone that obtained the best results in the various tests in terms of its petrophysical parameters was dolostone, while the worst performance was by one of the two limestones. These results were confirmed by the decay tests. The combined use of these different techniques gave us an accurate interpretation of the pore systems of the six different stones, and also enabled us to correct misleading interpretations caused by the limitations of using one single technique. Our findings also provide useful information to help prevent the decay of these stones. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

SEs are one of the main reasons of failures affecting electronic digital circuits operating in harsh radiation environments, such as in experiments performed at HEP colliders or in apparatus to be operated in space. In this paper we present and discuss the latest results of SE cross-section measurements performed using the STRURED digital device, exposed to high energy heavy ions at the SIRAD irradiation facility of the INFN National Laboratories of Legnaro (Padova, Italy).

Clearly water infrastructure is recognised as critical; the survival of a community depends on its ability to deliver fresh, clean drinking water to its consumers. Recent security breaches in Australia and abroad have led us to consider the issues of risk and consequence of deliberate attacks. However, securing water supply networks is a complex problem; therefore it is necessary to study risks and develop appropriate management strategies. This article reviews the characteristics of water supply systems and design traits that make them susceptible. The range of potential threats are classified; biological/chemical and physical that includes physical attack, cyber attack and hoaxes. Risk analysis methodologies to assess the vulnerability are outlined, along with possible countermeasures that may minimise threats. The review highlights the vulnerability of water supply systems to deliberate attacks and sabotage and the need for a comprehensive and holistic approach to risk management and countermeasures.

BMI can misclassify persons who carry more weight as fat-free mass and %fat can be misleading in cases of malnutrition or in disease states characterized by wasting of lean tissue. The fat-free mass index (FFMI) is proposed to assess body composition in individuals who have a similar body composition but differ in height allowing identification of those suffering from malnutrition, wasting or those that possess a relatively high muscle mass. The purpose was to determine whether the FFMI differs in a group of racially/ethnically diverse adults. Design: Cross-sectional. Subjects: Subjects were a multi-ethnic sample (Caucasian, CA; African American, AA; Hispanic, HIS and Asian, AS) of 1339 healthy males (n = 480) and females (n = 859) ranging in age from 18-110 years. Total body fat, total fat-free mass and bone mineral density were estimated using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: FFMI differed among the four ethnic groups (P <= 0.05) for both genders. A curvilinear relationship was found between age and FFMI for both genders although the coefficients in the quadratic model differed between genders (P <= 0.001) indicating the rate of change in FFMI differed between genders. The estimated turning point where FFMI started to decline was in the mid 20s for male and mid 40s for female participants. An age x gender interaction was found such that the rate of decline was greater in male than female participants (P <= 0.001). For both genders, FFMI was greatest in AA and the least in AS (P <= 0.001). There was no significant interaction between race and age or age(2) (P = 0.06). However, male participants consistently had a greater FFMI than female participants (P <= 0.001). Conclusions: These findings have clinical implications for identifying individuals who may not be recognized as being malnourished based on their BMI or %fat but whose fat-free mass corrected for height is relatively low.

However, that augmentation can mislead if it is done incorrectly and not within reasonable limits. When procedures are in place for ensuring that originals are archived, and image manipulation steps are reported, scientists not only follow good laboratory practices, but also avoid ethical issues associated with postprocessing and protect their labs from any future allegations of scientific misconduct. Also, when procedures are in place for correct acquisition of images, the extent of postprocessing is minimized or eliminated. These procedures include color balancing (for brighfield images), keeping tonal values within the dynamic range of the detector, frame averaging to eliminate noise (typically in fluorescence imaging), use of the highest bit depth when a choice is available, flatfield correction, and archiving of the image in a nonlossy format (not JPEG). When postprocessing is necessary, the commonly used applications for correction include Photoshop, and ImageJ, but a free program (GIMP) can also be used. Corrections to images include scaling the bit depth to higher and lower ranges, removing color casts from brightfield images, setting brightness and contrast, reducing color noise, reducing grainy noise, conversion of pure colors to grayscale, conversion of grayscale to colors typically used in fluorescence imaging, correction of uneven illumination and flatfield correction, blending color images (fluorescence), and extending the depth of focus. These corrections are explained in step-by-step procedures in the chapter that follows.","Sedgewick Initiat, St Paul, MN USA","Sedgewick, J (corresponding author), Sedgewick Initiat, St Paul, MN USA.",,,,,,,6,1,1,0,3,HUMANA PRESS INC,TOTOWA,"999 RIVERVIEW DR, STE 208, TOTOWA, NJ 07512-1165 USA",1064-3745,,978-1-61779-023-2,METHODS MOL BIOL,Methods Mol.

Methods: Data were obtained from five cross-sectional studies, representative of the population of Spain in 1987, 1995, 1997, 2001 and 2006/2007. Self-reported weight and height were used to obtain the body mass index (BMI). Overweight was defined in adults as BMI of >= 25 kg m(-2), and in children using age-and sex-specific BMI cutoffs proposed by the International Obesity Task Force. People with overweight were considered to have misperceived overweight when adults considered their weight or their child's weight to be normal or less than normal. Results: From 1987 to 2006/2007, the prevalence of overweight increased in absolute terms by 14.1% in men and 10.3% in women. Concurrently, the frequency of misperceived overweight remained relatively stable, approximately 35% in men, but rose from 16.5 to 20.8% in women. From 1995/1997 to 2006/2007, the prevalence of overweight increased in absolute terms by 3.2% in boys and 4.6% in girls. Over the same period, there was an absolute 8% increase in misperception of overweight among children of both sexes. As a result, during 2006/2007, approximately 60% of parents did not correctly perceive the weight status of their overweight children. Moreover, misperceived overweight was highest for younger children, and for those whose parents had a higher education. Conclusions: The obesity epidemic in Spain has been accompanied by an increased misperception of overweight in women and children of both sexes. Our results warn of the low family's readiness to modify the environment and lifestyle needed to control overweight.

Especially in patients with implanted cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD), they are well established and their usefulness and reliability have been shown in several clinical trials. Currently, three generations of Home Monitoring (TM) (HM, Biotronik GmbH & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany) are commercially available. Methods: This paper presents three cases demonstrating the various limitations of the first and second generations of HM and the way they can be overcome by the third generation. Results: In the first case, atrial flutter was misinterpreted by the device and classified as ventricular tachycardia (VT). Thus, in the online IEGM, supraventricular tachycardia was identified, and the short IEGM strip and lack of transmitted atrial signals of the dual-chamber device necessitated an appointment for ICD interrogation, to clarify the diagnosis and propose further treatment. The second case is that of a patient in whom a VT was ineffectively treated by anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) and continued with longer cycle length, leading to syncope. A second-generation HM device with online-IEGM misleadingly appears to indicate successful treatment. The third case demonstrates correct detection and therapy of a fast VT by an ICD of third-generation HM type. The online IEGM now gives all information needed for complete telemetric assessment. Conclusions: Home Monitoring (HM) is a helpful remote surveillance tool for the early detection of both arrhythmias and technical problems. As shown, the first two generations had limitations which the patient must take into account when using the system. These limitations have been overcome in the third generation, making Home Monitoring more self-sufficient and reliable.

The Delta Sigma-PWD employs the operation principle of a Delta Sigma modulator to convert the pulse-width (PW) value into digital domain and achieve fine resolution, which allows the SR-RX to support the 2-ASK/4-ASK modulations. It can be considered as the PW domain counterpart of a conventional Delta Sigma modulator. The proposed architecture is capable of suppressing the PW quantization error over the direct-sampling-type PW detector by 23 dB. A linear model for the Delta Sigma-PWD is devised in this paper for system analysis and design optimization. Fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process, the whole receiver draws 700 mu A from a 1.3-V supply, while the Delta Sigma-PWD consumes only 100 mu A. When operated on the 4-ASK modulation signal with 312-kbps data rate, the receiver achieves an energy efficiency of 2.9 nJ/bit and -76-dBm sensitivity.","[Liu, Yao-Hong] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Elect Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan; Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan","Liu, YH (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Elect Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",thlin@cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw,"Liu, Yao-Hong/X-1157-2019","Liu, Yao-Hong/0000-0002-3256-6741; Lin, Tsung-Hsien/0000-0002-1733-5945","National Science CouncilMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC98-2220-E-002-028]; Ministry of Economic Affairs, TaiwanMinistry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan [98-EC-17-A-01-S1-131, 98-EC-17-A-07-S2-0123]","Manuscript received January 24, 2010; revised June 21, 2010; accepted June 28, 2010.

An innovated BMI-PSA equation is designed. PSA-BMI adjusted formula (named Hekal's equation): measured total PSA (ng ml(-1)) multiplied by age (years) and divided by BMI of the patient. The formula is applied over a randomly chosen 1000 cases of different PSA, BMI, age and trans-rectal ultrasound biopsy results, the yield of new PSA is correlated with pathology and age-specific PSA adjustment values. Among the 988 cases with complete data, obesity (BMI: 30-35 kg m(-2)) in 236 cases (23.8%) and 79 cases (7.9%) have BMI>435 kg m(-2). Mean PSA was 5.8 ng ml(-1) (s.d. +/- 8.4 ng ml(-1)). Cases stratified based on their age (every 10 years). The new equation was applied. Obesity is detected in 33.5 and 43.6% of fifth and sixth decade of life respectively (P = 0.02), with low measured PSA values (2.1, 3.8 ng ml(-1), respectively). By such PSA measurement biopsy may be omitted, missing 53.3% of malignant cases. In contrast, PSA adjusted were 4 and 9.3 ng ml(-1) within the same group of patients. With such values, the decision of a biopsy could not be missed for the targeted groups. Specificity and sensitivity of adjusted PSA values at cutoff point 4 ng ml(-1) was 41.7 and 70%, respectively. Based on our results, the new PSA-BMI adjusted formula is reproducible, easy applied formula. With such a formula the higher sensitivity of PSA in obese patients could be achieved. The misleading low PSA in obese cases in the fifth and sixth decade will be corrected.

RSFQ is outstanding because of its very low switching energy resulting in very low power consumption. This advantage causes, however, a significant influence of thermal noise. For industrial applications, a certain noise immunity is required which is still a challenge, especially for circuits of higher complexity. Integrating phase-shifting elements is a new concept for further improvements concerning stability against the influence of thermal noise. We have already shown that the implementation of phase-shifting elements significantly reduces the influence of thermal noise on circuit behavior by experimentally analyzing the bit-error rate (Mielke et al 2009 IEEE Trans. Appl. Supercond. 19 621-5). Concepts which are easily implementable in standard niobium technology are especially promising. The pi-phaseshifter consists of a superconducting loop which is able to store a single flux quantum. The loop current related to the stored flux creates a well-defined phase shift. To achieve the correct functionality of complex circuits it is essential to store exactly one flux quantum in each pi-phaseshifter during the cooling down of the chip. Thus, for studying the feasibility of this new approach, the initialization reliability of the pi-phaseshifter needs to be verified. We present an experimental investigation of this reliability to obtain a general assessment for the application of the pi-phaseshifter in niobium technology. Furthermore, we compare the configuration shielded by a solid ground plane with a configuration with a ground-plane hole below the pi-phaseshifter. Justified by the experimental results we suggest programmable RSFQ circuits based on pi-phaseshifters. The characteristics of these devices can be influenced by a controlled initialization of the pi-phaseshifter. The fabrication was performed by FLUXONICS Foundry.","[Mielke, Olaf; Ortlepp, Thomas; Toepfer, Hannes] Ilmenau Univ Technol, Dept Adv Electromagnet, D-98684 Ilmenau, Germany; [Kunert, Juergen; Meyer, Hans-Georg] Inst Photon Technol eV, Dept Quantum Detect, D-07702 Jena, Germany","Mielke, O (corresponding author), Ilmenau Univ Technol, Dept Adv Electromagnet, POB 100565, D-98684 Ilmenau, Germany.",olaf.mielke@tu-ilmenau.de,"Ortlepp, Thomas/G-3250-2012; Kunert, Juergen/A-3478-2013","Toepfer, Hannes/0000-0001-9665-7661",German DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Uh137/8-1],This work was supported by the German DFG research project Uh137/8-1.,,17,6,6,0,3,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0953-2048,1361-6668,,SUPERCOND SCI TECH,Supercond.
