Traditionally, public service announcements (PSAs) consisted of video or radio messages, posters, or billboards created by government agencies and health organizations to provide information about health topics. However, the widespread use of the internet and the growth of social media has changed PSA creation and dissemination in many ways. Increasingly, a variety of actors, including non-official sources and lay persons, have been using social media to disseminate PSAs or PSA-like content. Audiences are larger and more engaged with content, and users have the novel ability to interact with PSAs through shares, likes, or comments. While social media for health communication has many advantages, there are also a number of disadvantages including misinformation, conspiracy theories, bots, and trolls. Credibility of different sources has also become a topic of debate. An ongoing challenge during the pandemic has been reaching audiences in a crowded online environment, establishing authority as a trusted source, and countering misinformation. In this paper, we discuss how the media landscape is changing PSAs and the implications of these changes in the context of pandemics. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094641773

The popular social media platform Instagram represents a significant source of exposure to health (mis)information; 1 in 3 US adults use Instagram. Objective: The objective of this analysis was to characterize pro- and anti-HPV vaccine networks on Instagram, and to describe misinformation within the anti-HPV vaccine network. Methods: From April 2018 to December 2018, we collected publicly available English-language Instagram posts containing hashtags #HPV, #HPVVaccine, or #Gardasil using Netlytic software (n=16,607). We randomly selected 10% of the sample and content analyzed relevant posts (n=580) for text, image, and social media features as well as holistic attributes (eg, sentiments, personal stories). Among antivaccine posts, we organized elements of misinformation within four broad dimensions: 1) misinformation theoretical domains, 2) vaccine debate topics, 3) evidence base, and 4) health beliefs. We conducted univariate, bivariate, and network analyses on the subsample of posts to quantify the role and position of individual posts in the network. Results: Compared to provaccine posts (324/580, 55.9%), antivaccine posts (256/580, 44.1%) were more likely to originate from individuals (64.1% antivaccine vs 25.0% provaccine; P<.001) and include personal narratives (37.1% vs 25.6%; P=.003). In the antivaccine network, core misinformation characteristics included mentioning #Gardasil, purporting to reveal a lie (ie, concealment), conspiracy theories, unsubstantiated claims, and risk of vaccine injury. Information/resource posts clustered around misinformation domains including falsification, nanopublications, and vaccine-preventable disease, whereas personal narrative posts clustered around different domains of misinformation, including concealment, injury, and conspiracy theories. The most liked post (6634 likes) in our full subsample was a positive personal narrative post, created by a non-health individual; the most liked post (5604 likes) in our antivaccine subsample was an informational post created by a health individual. Conclusions: Identifying characteristics of misinformation related to HPV vaccine on social media will inform targeted interventions (eg, network opinion leaders) and help sow corrective information and stories tailored to different falsehoods. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

These intentionally false or misleading stories threaten the democratic goal of a well-informed electorate. This study evaluates the effectiveness of strategies that could be used by Facebook and other social media to counter false stories. Results from a pre-registered experiment indicate that false headlines are perceived as less accurate when people receive a general warning about misleading information on social media or when specific headlines are accompanied by a “Disputed” or “Rated false” tag. Though the magnitudes of these effects are relatively modest, they generally do not vary by whether headlines were congenial to respondents’ political views. In addition, we find that adding a “Rated false” tag to an article headline lowers its perceived accuracy more than adding a “Disputed” tag (Facebook’s original approach) relative to a control condition. Finally, though exposure to the “Disputed” or “Rated false” tags did not affect the perceived accuracy of unlabeled false or true headlines, exposure to a general warning decreased belief in the accuracy of true headlines, suggesting the need for further research into how to most effectively counter false news without distorting belief in true information. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Corrections; Fact check; Fake news; Misperceptions; Social media; Warnings",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061502088

To assess misinformation about health risk from casual contact with fentanyl, we characterize its diffusion and excess visibility in mainstream and social media. Methods: We used Media Cloud to compile and characterize mainstream and social media content published between January 2015 and September 2019 on overdose risk from casual fentanyl exposure. Results: Relevant content appeared in 551 news articles spanning 48 states. Misinformed media reports received approximately 450,000 Facebook shares, potentially reaching nearly 70,000,000 users from 2015-2019. Amplified by erroneous government statements, misinformation received excess social media visibility by a factor of 15 compared to corrective content, which garnered fewer than 30,000 shares with potential reach of 4,600,000 Facebook users. Conclusion: Health-related misinformation continues to proliferate online, hampering responses to public health crises. More evidence-informed tools are needed to effectively challenge misinformed narratives in mainstream and social media. © 2020","Fentanyl; Health misinformation; Law enforcement; Overdose","fentanyl; naloxone; Article; cloud computing; controlled study; drug exposure; health hazard; human; misinformation; occupational hazard; policy; priority journal; social media",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090884707

To date no high quality clinical trials reporting on the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids on reducing inflammatory markers have been published. Our paper uses network analysis, citation context analysis, and retraction status visibility analysis to illustrate the potential for extended propagation of misinformation over a citation network, updating and extending a case study of the first 6 years of post-retraction citation (Fulton et al. in Publications 3(1):7–26, 2015. https://doi.org/10.3390/publications3010017). The current study covers 148 direct citations from 2006 through 2019 and their 2542 second-generation citations and assesses retraction status visibility of the case study paper and its retraction notice on 12 digital platforms as of 2020. The retraction is not mentioned in 96% (107/112) of direct post-retraction citations for which we were able to conduct citation context analysis. Over 41% (44/107) of direct post-retraction citations that do not mention the retraction describe the case study paper in detail, giving a risk of diffusing misinformation from the case paper. We analyze 152 second-generation citations to the most recent 35 direct citations (2010–2019) that do not mention the retraction but do mention methods or results of the case paper, finding 23 possible diffusions of misinformation from these non-direct citations to the case paper. Link resolving errors from databases show a significant challenge in a reader reaching the retraction notice via a database search. Only 1/8 databases (and 1/9 database records) consistently resolved the retraction notice to its full-text correctly in our tests. Although limited to evaluation of a single case (N = 1), this work demonstrates how retracted research can continue to spread and how the current information environment contributes to this problem. © 2020, The Author(s).","Case study; Citation context analysis; Diffusion studies; Link resolver errors; Misinformation; Post-retraction citation; Problematic citation; Problems with bibliographic libraries; Retraction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092601632

Some advocacy groups have argued that the use of such redundant labels is misleading or unethical. To determine whether premiums for redundant labels stem from misunderstanding or other factors, this study seeks to determine whether greater knowledge of the claims - in the form of expertise in food production and scientific literacy - decreases willingness to pay for redundant labels. We also explore whether de-biasing information influences consumers’ valuations of redundant labels. An online survey of 1122 U.S. consumers elicited preferences for three redundantly labeled products: non-GMO sea salt, gluten-free orange juice, and no-hormone-added chicken breast. Respondents with farm experience report lower premiums for non-GMO salt and no-hormone-added chicken. Those with higher scientific literacy state lower premiums for gluten-free orange juice. However, after providing information about the redundancy of the claims, less than half of respondents who were initially willing to pay extra for the label are convinced otherwise. Over 30% of respondents counter-intuitively increase their premiums, behavior that is associated with less a priori scientific knowledge. The likelihood of “overpricing” redundant labels is associated with willingness-to-pay premiums for organic food, suggesting at least some of the premium for organic is a result of misinformation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","De-bias; Gluten-free; GMO; Hormone; Labelling; Organic; Scientific literacy","Citrus sinensis; Gallus gallus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087733212

Nor was there a study exploring the experience of patients in their breast cancer journey. Methods: A qualitative interview study with thematic analysis, conducted with 36 patients. Results: There is no clear pattern of presentation for breast cancer by cancer stage at diagnosis, age and ethnicity in the cancer journey of this group of patients. Patients were diagnosed with early to advanced stages cancer regardless of when they presented or took up treatment in their cancer journey. The reasons patients sought medical attention also did not appear to differ between the stages of cancer diagnosed, ethnic and age. Without setting a measure to define early and late presentation, we found that women shared similar experience in their breast cancer journey, regardless of age, ethnicity and stage of cancer at diagnosis. Poor knowledge of breast cancer (symptoms and causes); few practised regular BSE; denial of symptom; fear of hospitalisation, diagnosis and treatment; worries and stress over financial burden of treatment; misinformation in magazine and online sources; diet; stress; caring responsibility; support network; and use of alternative medicine before and after diagnosis were identified in patients’ narratives. Strong social support; fear of being an emotional and financial burden for the family; and financial worries during treatment were also the recurring themes after diagnosis. Conclusion: A measure of breast cancer presentation - that accounts for the patient’s experience in the cancer journey, the time interval and tumour biology – that is meaningful to patients, clinicians and researchers is needed. For research on late and delayed presentation, details on BSE practice – how often, when and was it done correctly – will improve the accuracy of time delay interval. For the public, concerted efforts to improve knowledge of breast cancer, survival and prognosis for early-diagnosed cancer, and the importance of regular and correct technique to perform BSE, are critical and urgent to address the rising breast cancer incidence in the country. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cancer journey; Experience; Help seeking behaviour; Presentation of breast cancer; Qualitative study; Singapore",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095705945

Benefiting from their ultraminiaturized size and transparent constituents, these clandestine nanoelectromechanical tags provide substantial immunity to physical tampering and cloning. Adaptive algorithms are developed for digital translation of the spectral signature into binary fingerprints. A large set of tags fabricated in the same batch is used to estimate the entropy of the corresponding fingerprints with high accuracy. The tags are also examined under repetitive measurements and temperature variations to verify the consistency of the fingerprints.

Findings from a survey of 511 Chinese respondents suggest that, overall, individuals would perceive themselves to be less vulnerable than close others and distant others to the impact of COVID-19 digital disinformation. The highest self-other perceptual discrepancy is found when individuals receive disinformation on mobile social networking apps. Also, individuals who practice more active fact-checking perceive themselves to be less susceptible. The perception of disinformation effects on self as well as the self-other perceptual discrepancy is both positively related to emotional responses (anxiety, fear, and worry) to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study contributes to existing research by linking exposure to disinformation in different digital channels, the TPEs, and emotional outcomes in the context of a public health crisis. It also highlights the importance of educating and enabling fact-checking behaviors on digital media, which could help to reduce negative emotional impact of the disinformation. © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","digital disinformation; fact-checking; negative emotions; third-person effect","Coronavirus infection; deception; human; Internet; pandemic; questionnaire; social media; social network; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus Infections; Deception; Humans; Internet; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media; Social Networking; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095946416

Respondents were asked about receiving COVID-19 misinformation using 12 items identified by the World Health Organization. Logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for the association of receiving misinformation with sociodemographic characteristics, source of information, COVID-19 misinformation belief, and psychological distress, as well as the associations of COVID-19 misinformation belief with COVID-19 knowledge and the number of COVID-19 preventive behaviors among those who received the misinformation. All data were weighted according to the Korea census data in 2018.Background: Online misinformation proliferation during the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major public health concern. Objective: We aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation exposure and beliefs, associated factors including psychological distress with misinformation exposure, and the associations between COVID-19 knowledge and number of preventive behaviors.Conclusions: COVID-19 misinformation exposure was associated with misinformation belief, while misinformation belief was associated with fewer preventive behaviors. Given the potential of misinformation to undermine global efforts in COVID-19 disease control, up-to-date public health strategies are required to counter the proliferation of misinformation.Results: Overall, 67.78% (n=711) of respondents reported exposure to at least one COVID-19 misinformation item. Misinformation exposure was associated with younger age, higher education levels, and lower income. Sources of information associated with misinformation exposure were social networking services (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.20-2.32) and instant messaging (aOR 1.79, 1.27-2.51). Misinformation exposure was also associated with psychological distress including anxiety (aOR 1.80, 1.24-2.61), depressive (aOR 1.47, 1.09-2.00), and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (aOR 1.97, 1.42-2.73), as well as misinformation belief (aOR 7.33, 5.17-10.38).

The lessons learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak indicate that knowledge and attitudes about infectious diseases are related to panic among the population, which may further complicate efforts to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Misunderstandings may result in behaviors such as underestimation, panic, and taking ineffective measures to avoid infection; these behaviors are likely to cause the epidemic to spread further. Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess public health perceptions and misunderstandings about COVID-19 in China, and to propose targeted response measures based on the findings to control the development of the epidemic. Methods: The study was conducted in April 2020 through an online survey, with participants in 8 provinces in Eastern, Central, and Western China. We designed a questionnaire with a health knowledge section consisting of 5 questions (4 conventional questions and 1 misleading question) on clinical features of and preventive measures against COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square analysis, binary logistic regression, and Mantel-Haenszel hierarchical analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results: In total, 4788 participants completed the survey and the mean knowledge score was 4.63 (SD 0.67), gained mainly through experts (76.1%), television (60.0%), newspapers (57.9%), and opinions (46.6%) and videos (42.9%) from social media. Compared to those who obtained information from only 1 or 2 channels, people who obtained information from >3 channels had increased health perception and a better ability to identify misleading information. Suggestions from experts were the most positive information source (χ2=41.61), while information on social media was the most misleading. Those aged >60 years (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.10-2.11), those with a lower or middle income (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.00-1.83), those not working and not able to work (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.04-3.21), those with a household income <100,000 RMB (<US $14,954; OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.08-1.67), and those with >2 suspected symptoms (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.50-5.80) were more likely to be misled by videos on social media, but the error correction effect of expert advice was limited in these groups. Conclusions: Multiple information channels can improve public health perception and the identification of misleading information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Videos on social media increased the risk of rumor propagation among vulnerable groups. We suggest the government should strengthen social media regulation and increase experts’ influence on the targeted vulnerable populations to reduce the risk of rumors spreading. ©Jiawei Zhou, Bishwajit Ghose, Ruoxi Wang, Ruijun Wu, Zhifei Li, Rui Huang,","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Knowledge; Online; Pandemic; Perceptions; Public health; Rapid; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys","adolescent; adult; aged; attitude to health; Betacoronavirus; child; China; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; female; health education; human; Internet; interpersonal communication; male; middle aged; pandemic; psychology; public health; questionnaire; social media; very elderly; virus pneumonia; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Child; China; Communication; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093935641

Misinformation about abortion is pervasive and propagated by state-mandated scripts that contain abortion myths. We sought to investigate women's knowledge of abortion laws in their state. Our secondary objective was to describe women's ability to discern myths about abortion from facts about abortion. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study of English- and Spanish-speaking women aged 18–49 in the United States. We enrolled members of the GfK KnowledgePanel, a probability-based, nationally-representative online sample. Our primary outcome was the proportion of correct answers to 12 questions about laws regulating abortion in a respondent's state. We asked five questions about common abortion myths. We used descriptive statistics to characterize performance on these measures and bivariate and multivariate modeling to identify risk factors for poor knowledge of state abortion laws. Results: Of 2223 women contacted, 1057 (48%) completed the survey. The mean proportion of correct answers to 12 law questions was 18% (95% CI 17–20%). For three of five assessed myths, women endorsed myths about abortion over facts. Those who believe abortion should be illegal (aOR 2.18, CI 1.40–3.37), and those living in states with neutral or hostile state policies toward abortion (neutral aOR 1.99, CI 1.34–2.97; hostile aOR 1.6, CI 1.07–2.36) were at increased odds of poor law knowledge. Conclusions: Women had low levels of knowledge about state abortion laws and commonly endorse abortion myths. Women's knowledge of their state's abortion laws was associated with personal views about abortion and their state policy environment. Implications: Supporters of reproductive rights can use these results to show policy makers that their constituents are unlikely to know about laws being passed that may profoundly affect them. These findings underscore the potential benefit in correcting widely-held, medically-inaccurate beliefs about abortion so opinions about laws can be based on fact. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Abortion; Abortion myths; Access to abortion; Reproductive health; Reproductive rights; TRAP laws","abortion; adult; anxiety disorder; Article; cross-sectional study; depression; female; health literacy; human; knowledge; major clinical study; middle aged; outcome assessment; pregnancy; reproductive rights; risk factor; United States; women's health; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090484165

We herein introduce an integration of digital image processing with a model PAD for easing and improving the signal readout procedure. The colorimetric detection mechanism of PAD relies on in-situ induced yellowish silver nanoparticles via the interaction of silver ions, poly(vinyl alcohol), and ammonia with isoniazid. The observed color value is related with the concentration of isoniazid. The proposed algorithm is based on mathematical morphology recognition, and minimizes the errors arising from manual area selection. Besides, it allows the recognition of both circle and square shapes in 96-well plate and A4 size array designs. Since this algorithm automatically provides the blank-corrected numerical matrixes and image profiles of red, green and blue channels, further investigations such as outlier classification, construction of regression/prediction models and calculation of detection limit can be easily performed. Comparison of signal readout results of the developed algorithm with ImageJ software demonstrates significant improvements in analysis speed, reproducibility, accuracy and color values. Therefore, application of the proposed algorithm is promising as a robust technique for practical applications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic signal readout; Isoniazid; Mathematical morphological image processing algorithm; Paper-based analytical devices","Ammonia; Analytic equipment; Color; Color image processing; Hydrazine; Image enhancement; Mathematical morphology; Metal ions; Polyvinyl alcohols; Silver nanoparticles; Colorimetric detection; Detection limits; Image profile; Paper-based analytical devices; Red , green and blues; Reproducibilities; Robust technique; Signal readouts; Colorimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087810464

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of information available on YouTube about restless leg syndrome (RLS). Methods: A YouTube search was carried out on https://www.youtube.com for videos pertaining to “restless leg syndrome” by using the keyword “restless leg syndrome”. The first 100 relevant videos were included in the study. The videos were accepted as “useful” if they provided scientifically correct information about any aspect of RLS. The videos containing scientifically unproven information are defined as “misleading”. The overall quality of all videos was subjectively graded using the global quality scale (GQS), a 5-point Likert scale. Results: The median video length for the included videos was 3.39 (0.11-85) minutes, and the median views were 6,055 (32-2351490). The median GQS of useful videos was 3 (1-5). The median number of likes and the median number of comments of personal experience videos were significantly higher than that of the useful and misleading videos. Videos uploaded by the university hospitals frequently issued pharmacological treatment of the RLS; however, those uploaded by practitioners, individual users, and TV or social media accounts were about the non-pharmacological treatment of the RLS. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that 77% of the videos uploaded on YouTube regarding RLS are in the useful category, whereas only 16 videos were providing misleading information.

Using the entrepreneurial marketing (EM) perspective of “co-creation of value”, this paper aims to explore the manner in which consumers of political communications in a specific region have created user generated value via setting up Facebook forums to manage the risk created by fake news and the trust deficit between citizens and mainstream media (MSM). Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a “netnographic” approach to investigation and the data is analysed manual coding (Kozinets, 2015). Facebook groups form the virtual research field in in the context of this study. This approach is adopted because in a social media environment, netnography capitalises over a growing virtual and online communities and allows researchers to study the richness of these online communities (Mkono and Markwell, 2014). Findings: The study provides insights on how administrators and moderators of Facebook groups create value for other users by identifying and communicating the risks emerging from social media-based political communication. The study finds that such citizen-led initiatives act as online social aggregators. The value that such groups offer its users/members resides within a well-bound, controlled and moderated online medium that encourages users to counter fake news and misinformation – thereby solving a key problem within the user market i.e. citizen-media trust deficit. Research limitations/implications: The study uses a qualitative, netnographic approach and the emerging insights cannot be generalised. The emergent findings are specific to the context of this study and researchers are encouraged to further test the propositions emerging from this research in varied contexts. Practical implications: The study extends the application of EM in political contexts using the seven dimensions of EM, which will provide impetus for future political campaigns in terms of unique value creation for publics. The paper also emerges with the role citizen-initiated forums can play in the effective dissemination of digital political communication as user generated content is aiding political debate. Social implications: The study helps highlight the role Facebook forums can play in informing the political discourse within a region. The general distrust amongst the citizens over information produced by MSM has meant vocal critics have taken to Facebook to provide their subjective opinions. Although the findings of this study show that such forums can help identify “fake news” and help citizens discuss and debate the truth, it can also become an avenue to manage propaganda amongst the “unaware” citizens.

Monitoring social media data has been identified as the best method for tracking rumors in real time and as a possible way to dispel misinformation and reduce stigma. However, the detection, assessment, and response to rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories in real time are a challenge. Therefore, we followed and examined COVID-19-related rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories circulating on online platforms, including fact-checking agency websites, Facebook, Twitter, and online newspapers, and their impacts on public health. Information was extracted between December 31, 2019 and April 5, 2020, and descriptively analyzed. We performed a content analysis of the news articles to compare and contrast data collected from other sources. We identified 2,311 reports of rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories in 25 languages from 87 countries. Claims were related to illness, transmission and mortality (24%), control measures (21%), treatment and cure (19%), cause of disease including the origin (15%), violence (1%), and miscellaneous (20%). Of the 2,276 reports for which text ratings were available, 1,856 claims were false (82%). Misinformation fueled by rumors, stigma, and conspiracy theories can have potentially serious implications on the individual and community if prioritized over evidence-based guidelines. Health agencies must track misinformation associated with the COVID-19 in real time, and engage local communities and government stakeholders to debunk misinformation.

The ever-growing rise in the popularity of OSNs can be attributed to the rapid growth of Internet technology. OSN becomes the easiest way to broadcast media (news/content) over the Internet. In the wake of emerging technologies, there is dire need to develop methodologies, which can minimize the spread of fake messages or rumors that can harm society in any manner. In this article, a model is proposed to investigate the propagation of such messages currently coined as fake news. The proposed model describes how misinformation gets disseminated among groups with the influence of different misinformation refuting measures. With the onset of the novel coronavirus-19 pandemic, dubbed COVID-19, the propagation of fake news related to the pandemic is higher than ever. In this article, we aim to develop a model that will be able to detect and eliminate fake news from OSNs and help ease some OSN users stress regarding the pandemic. A system of differential equations is used to formulate the model. Its stability and equilibrium are also thoroughly analyzed. The basic reproduction number (R0) is obtained which is a significant parameter for the analysis of message spreading in the OSNs. If the value of R0 is less than one (R0 &lt; 1), then fake message spreading in the online network will not be prominent, otherwise if R0 &gt; 1 the rumor will persist in the OSN. Real-world trends of misinformation spreading in OSNs are discussed. In addition, the model discusses the controlling mechanism for untrusted message propagation. The proposed model has also been validated through extensive simulation and experimentation. © IEEE 2020.","Basic reproduction number; Equilibrium; Fake news; Online social networks (OSNs); Rumor detection; Rumor propagation","Cell proliferation; Differential equations; Basic reproduction number; Controlling mechanism; Emerging technologies; Extensive simulations; Internet technology; On-line social networks; Online social networks (OSNs); System of differential equations; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096051546

This study uses an experimental design on a national sample to test two features of user-based correction strategies on Instagram for a divisive issue on which misinformation abounds: the issue of climate change. First, we unite the inoculation and correction literature to test the efficacy of prebunking corrections that come before exposure to the misinformation versus debunking strategies that occur after exposure. Second, we compare fact-focused corrections that provide accurate information to rebut the misinformation against logic-focused corrections that highlight the rhetorical flaw underpinning the misinformation. Our findings suggest that these strategies intersect to reduce misperceptions. Logic-focused corrections effectively reduce misperceptions regardless of their placement before or after the misinformation, and appear to function in part by reducing perceptions of the credibility of the misinformation post. Fact-focused corrections only reduce misperceptions when they occur after the misinformation, but are seen as more credible than logic-focused corrections. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the theoretical mechanism by which correction can occur and the practical guidelines to best correct misinformation in visual social media spaces. © The Author(s) 2020.","climate change; climate change misinformation; correction; inoculation; Instagram; misinformation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085388027

There has been a corresponding increase in research aimed at understanding opinions and beliefs that are expressed online. However, the generalizability of findings from social media research is a subject of ongoing debate. Social media platforms are conduits of both information and misinformation about vaccines and vaccine hesitancy. Our research objective was to examine whether we can draw similar conclusions from Twitter and national survey data about the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and a broader set of beliefs. In 2018 we conducted a nationally representative survey of parents in the United States informed by a literature review to ask their views on a range of topics, including vaccine side effects, conspiracy theories, and understanding of science. We developed a set of keyword-based queries corresponding to each of the belief items from the survey and pulled matching tweets from 2017. We performed the data pull of the most recent full year of data in 2018. Our primary measures of belief covariation were the loadings and scores of the first principal components obtained using principal component analysis (PCA) from the two sources. We found that, after using manually coded weblinks in tweets to infer stance, there was good qualitative agreement between the first principal component loadings and scores using survey and Twitter data. This held true after we took the additional processing step of resampling the Twitter data based on the number of topics that an individual tweeted about, as a means of correcting for differential representation for elicited (survey) vs. volunteered (Twitter) beliefs. Overall, the results show that analyses using Twitter data may be generalizable in certain contexts, such as assessing belief covariation. Copyright: © 2020 Nowak et al.

To report on vaccine opposition and misinformation promoted on Twitter, highlighting Twitter accounts that drive conversation.Methods. We used supervised machine learning to code all Twitter posts. We first identified codes and themes manually by using a grounded theoretical approach and then applied them to the full data set algorithmically. We identified the top 50 authors month-over-month to determine influential sources of information related to vaccine opposition.Results. The data collection period was June 1 to December 1, 2019, resulting in 356 594 mentions of vaccine opposition. A total of 129 Twitter authors met the qualification of a top author in at least 1 month. Top authors were responsible for 59.5% of vaccine-opposition messages. We identified 10 conversation themes. Themes were similarly distributed across top authors and all other authors mentioning vaccine opposition. Top authors appeared to be highly coordinated in their promotion of misinformation within themes.Conclusions. Public health has struggled to respond to vaccine misinformation. Results indicate that sources of vaccine misinformation are not as heterogeneous or distributed as it may first appear given the volume of messages. There are identifiable upstream sources of misinformation, which may aid in countermessaging and public health surveillance.",,"vaccine; anti-vaccination movement; human; interpersonal communication; public health; social media; Anti-Vaccination Movement; Communication; Humans; Public Health; Social Media; Vaccines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092510132

Strong adherence to preventive measures can help to break the chain of the spread of coronavirus. We conducted this study to find out the extent of information general people of Eastern Nepal have regarding COVID-19 and their attitude and practice towards preventing its spread. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional online study was done among the people of Eastern Nepal on knowledge, attitude, and practice related to COVID-19 from May 1st to May 15th after obtaining ethical clearance from the ethical review board (ERB) (ref no. 319/2020 P). A 20 item survey instrument was adapted using WHO course materials on an emerging COVID-19. A convenience sample method was used. Data were collected and entered in Statistical Packages for Social Services version 11.5. Point estimate at 95% Confidence Interval was calculated along with frequency and proportion for binary data. Results: Among 1069 respondents, the correct answer on the COVID-19 related knowledge questionnaire was 958 (89.61%), 487 (93.11%) were health professionals, and 471 (86.26%) non-health professionals. Preventive measures were strictly followed by 1044 (97.66%) participants. A wrong perception about the disease was present in 390 (36.48%). Health ministry website 356 (33.30%) followed by news media 309 (29%) was the major source of information among the people. Conclusions: Knowledge regarding COVID-19 among people the selected population of eastern is satisfactory which was similar to other studies done. However, people still have misperceptions regarding the disease and do not strictly follow the preventive measures. © The Author(s) 2018.","COVID-19; Eastern Nepal; Information","adult; Article; attitude to health; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; female; health practitioner; health survey; human; infection prevention; information processing; major clinical study; male; medical information; Nepal; perception; questionnaire; World Health Organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092691191

It was reported that rumors were hampering the response effort. We sought to identify any rumors that could have influenced outbreak containment and affected prevention in unaffected areas of DR Congo. Methods We conducted a qualitative study in DR Congo over a period of 2 months (from August 1 to September 30, 2019) using in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). The participants were recruited from five regional blocks using purposeful sampling. Both areas currently undergoing outbreaks and presently unaffected areas were included. We collected participants' opinions, views, and beliefs about the Ebola virus. The IDIs (n = 60) were performed with key influencers (schoolteachers, religious and political leaders/analysts, and Ebola-frontline workers), following a semi-structured interview guide. FGDs (n = 10) were conducted with community members. Interviews were recorded with a digital voice recorder and simultaneous note-taking. Participant responses were categorized in terms of their themes and subthemes. Results We identified 3 high-level themes and 15 subthemes (given here in parentheses): (1) inadequate knowledge of the origin or cause of Ebola (belief in a metaphysical origin, insufficient awareness of Ebola transmission via an infected corpse, interpretation of disease as God's punishment, belief in nosocomial Ebola, poor hygiene, and bathing in the Congo River). Ebola was interpreted as (2) a plot by multinational corporations (fears of genocide, Ebola understood as a biological weapon, concerns over organ trafficking, and Ebola was taken to be the result of business actions). Finally Ebola was rumored to be subject to (3) politicization (political authorities seen as ambivalent, exclusion of some community leaders from response efforts, distrust of political authorities, and distrust in the healthcare system). Conclusions Due to the skepticism against Ebola countermeasures, it is critical to understand widespread beliefs about the disease to implement actions that will be effective, including integrating response with the unmet needs of the population. © 2020 Muzembo et al.

It composes of a 6-bit coarse counter TDC, and a 6-bit fine TDC. The fine TDC utilizes a proposed branching technique to interpolate between the phases of a 16-stage gated ring oscillator, increasing its number of phases from 16 to 64. Therefore, the TDC resolution is improved to be 4 times finer. The TDC incorporates fully digital based resolution tuning capability that enables its resolution to be more stable over PVT variations. Measurement results show that the resolution tuning reduces the resolution variation by 92.3% over a temperature range of − 40 to 125 °C. However, the simple resolution tuning method causes the TDC to have a relatively large resolution of 36.2 ps. The trade-offs between TDC resolution, yield, and scalability are discussed. The proposed TDC uses simple gated inverters based samplers instead of conventional arbiters to reduce power and area consumption. In addition, power gating features of the proposed TDC enable a low power consumption of 275 µW at a sampling rate of 5 MS/s. Without any linearity calibrations, the TDC DNL, INL, single-shot precision, and figure-of-merit are measured to be 1.30 LSB, 3.61 LSB, 0.75 LSB, and 61.9 fJ/conv.-step, respectively. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Branching; Bridging capacitors; Coarse-fine; Gated inverters based sampler; Phase interpolation; Power gating; Resolution tuning; TDC; Time-to-digital converter","Economic and social effects; Signal processing; Branching time; CMOS technology; Figure of merits; Low-power consumption; Resolution variations; Ring oscillator; Temperature range; Tuning capability; Frequency converters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087314885

Methods: An intraoral scanner (LAVA TDS) was used to scan a prepared molar abutment as a master model. The STL file obtained from the scanning process was transferred into the FDM 3D printer (Value 3D Magix MF-1000) and then models were fabricated with PVA filament. In order to compare with the conventional method, an impression of the master model was taken using silicone impression material to fabricate the conventional stone cast model (Conv). An indirect resin composite (Gradia) and self-cured acrylic resin (Curergrace) were used to fabricate crowns (n = 20) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Surface accuracy of the Conv and PVA models and internal accuracy of the crowns set on the models were measured using two methods; 3D digital analysis and silicon-fitting evaluation. Statistical analysis of the results was done using t-test and Willcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni correction at 5% significance. Results: Digital analysis showed the Root Mean Square (RMS) value of PVA model surface was higher than that of Conv, while there was no significant difference between the two crown materials. However, the silicon-fitting analysis showed marginal discrepancy of crowns fabricated on PVA model were within 100 µm. Conclusion: 3D printed PVA model can be used for chairside crown fabrication with an acceptable accuracy. © 2019","3D printer; Dimensional accuracy; Fused deposition modeling; Polyvinyl alcohol; Provisional crown","polyvinyl alcohol; computer aided design; dental impression; dental marginal adaptation; prosthesis design; three dimensional printing; tooth crown; Computer-Aided Design; Crowns; Dental Impression Technique; Dental Marginal Adaptation; Dental Prosthesis Design; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Printing, Three-Dimensional",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079412366

The correction of nasal deviation in an asymmetrical face can be challenging because known facial landmarks may mislead the surgeon. Eyebrows trimmed asymmetrically in an effort to create a more symmetrical facial appearance may be overlooked by surgeons. Objective: To define the relationship between the eyebrow position and external nasal deviation in patients with a crooked nose. Design, Setting, and Participants: Analysis was made of the preoperative and 6-month postoperative life-size photographs of female rhinoplasty patients who had been referred to the senior author’s clinic between May 2014 and June 2019. The anthropometric landmarks on the life-size photographs were identifed. The most medial points of the eyebrows and most deviated part of the nose were marked and the distance from the mid-canthal point was measured. Main Outcomes and Measure: The direction and amount of eyebrow shift were compared with the direction and amount of nasal deviation. Results: Of the total 94 female rhinoplasty patients with at least one level external nasal deviation, 67 (71.2%) had ipsilateral eyebrow shift with external nasal deviation. The preoperative external nasal deviation amount was 1.81 ± 1.21 mm and preoperative eyebrow shift was 1.18 ± 1.06 mm (rS = 0.429, p ' 0.001). The postoperative nasal deviation was 0.79 ± 0.92 mm, and the eyebrow shift was 0.54 ± 0.62 mm (rS = 0.570, p ' 0.001). Conclusion and Relevance: Patients may tend to trim their eyebrows towards the side of the external nasal deviation. After centralization of the crooked nose with rhinoplasty, asymmetric eyebrow shaping tendencies of the patients were also seen to be improved.

ROS may trigger DNA damage, cell mutation, inflammation, cell proliferation, and ultimately they may induce carcinogenesis. This study aims to design, fabricate, and develop a novel on-chip ROS detection based on mounted in-house built fluorescence microscope in microfluidics, which has not been reported previously. An in-house 3D printed built digital portable fluorescence type microscope for on-chip ROS detection has been developed. The combined use of the fluorescence microscope and a glass-based microfluidic chip both enabled to provide high-quality images of the living cells with ease of controlling and handling of the biological sample. As an evidence of the fluorescence microscope, breast cancer cells were loaded with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA, 50 μM) for 45 min on-chip which produces green fluorescence upon reaction with intracellular ROS. Fluorescence of the MCF-7 cells has been captured to obtain a profile of ROS generation for 1 day. LabVIEW 2019 was used along with its high-performance image analysis and IMAQ Vision tools. The viability of the cells was performed by LIVE/DEAD assay and Luna cell counter. The developed platform provides real-time monitoring and quantification of ROS. A strong linear correlation between concentrations versus fluorescence has been recorded. This result recommends that the current microfluidic chip provides an in-vitro platform for the assessment of cell cycle progression and evaluation of the variety of drugs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","DCFDA; Fluorescence microscopy; MCF-7 cells; Microfluidic chip; Real-time monitoring","3D printers; Cell proliferation; Fluidic devices; Microfluidics; Microscopes; Oxygen; Pathology; Quality control; Reactive oxygen species; Signal detection; Biological effects; Biological samples; Breast cancer cells; Cell-cycle progression; Dichlorofluorescein; High quality images; Real time monitoring; Real-time detection; Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091333904

However, the Mn2+-doping amount should be strictly controlled to evade the side effects (e.g., phase degradation or photoluminescence quenching), which will further lead to low lab-to-lab or people-to-people reproducibility. Fabricating heterometallic perovskite has been anticipated to produce new electronic and optical functionalities because of the interaction between mixed polyhedrons in a single phase. Here, a novel lead-free all-inorganic perovskite, Cs4MnBi2Cl12, with two-dimensional structure was synthesized, in which [BiCl6]3− acted as the sensitizer to enhance the light-absorption ability and further boost the activation of electrons in d orbitals of Mn2+. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.A novel lead-free all-inorganic perovskite single crystal, Cs4MnBi2Cl12, with two-dimensional structure is synthesized, in which [BiCl6]3− acts as the efficient sensitizer to enhance the light absorption and further boost the activation of electrons in d orbitals of Mn2+. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.A luminescent all-inorganic manganese-bismuth heterometallic Cs4MnBi2Cl12 perovskite single crystal has been synthesized with a [BiCl6]3−-[MnCl6]4−-[BiCl6]3− triple-layered two-dimensional structure. Benefit from the effective energy transfer from [BiCl6]3− octahedron donor to luminescent [MnCl6]4− acceptor, Cs4MnBi2Cl12 shows a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 25.7% (~610 nm), 51-fold higher than the Bi unalloyed CsMnCl3·2H2O counterpart. Suggested by the theoretical calculations, Bi and Mn exhibit hybridization in conduction and valence band, which further results in a favorable low activation energy for exciton transfer (~23 meV). By virtue of all-inorganic chemical composition, Cs4MnBi2Cl12 exhibits impressive stability toward moisture, light, and heat. Furthermore, Cs4MnBi2Cl12 features strong soft X-ray attenuation and bright radiative luminescence under X-ray excitation, which pave a way for its application in medical flat-panel X-ray digital radiography.

For instance, the recent outcomes of the US presidential elections and the Brexit vote show that misinformation and otherwise influencing content can affect events of great importance. In this paper, we adopt a simplified version of the recently proposed Network Knowledge Base (NKB) model to tackle the problem of predicting basic actions that a user can take given the content of their social media feeds: either take action (by reusing content seen in their feeds or creating new one), or otherwise take no action. We propose processing raw data obtained from social media based on the framework defined by the NKB model, and then formulate an action/no action prediction task that takes as input five features (including the user's personality type and other social cues), and then go on to show—via an extensive empirical evaluation with real-world Twitter data—that machine learning classification algorithms can be successfully applied in this setting to make predictions about user reactions. The main result obtained is that, out of the features considered, personality type based on the Big-5 (also known as OCEAN) model is the most impactful; furthermore, though the rest of the features taken individually do not have a significant impact, the best results are obtained when they are all taken together. This is a first step in applying the NKB model towards understanding the effect of pathogenic social media phenomena such as fake news, how they spread via cascades, and how to counteract their ill effects. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Hybrid artificial intelligence models; Social knowledge bases; Social networks","Data handling; Forecasting; Knowledge based systems; Machine learning; Empirical evaluations; Hybrid artificial intelligences; Information flows; Machine learning classification; Network knowledge; Personality types; Presidential election; Social Knowledge; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075402220

The situation was made worse by the spread of rumors and false information about what this virus is and ways to prevent it. Objective: Test how people interact with different information circulating through social media and online platforms. Methods: The DATA was taken from a survey conducted in 2020 on 1500 quarantined people between the ages 18-60 years old. A questionnaire was created containing most of the rumors and false information circulated, in addition to the correct information with a reliable source. The results were analyzed in the form of tables showing the proportions of supporters and opponents and expressed in numbers and percentages. Results: A total of 2000 quarantined people participated in the study with the mean age (30.35 ± 9.9 years). Where the response rate is 100%. The analysis showed a large percentage of support for health protections against the Corona virus, and a large rejection of most of the fake information and rumors circulating across the Internet platforms, in addition to their solidarity within the principles of social responsibility. Conclusion: The extent of the spread of rumors and false information is decreasing based on the presence of governments and the competent authorities through their official platforms within the mechanism of fighting against the Corona virus, and also taking advantage of the current mistakes to be a shield in the future in dealing with such crises. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Coronavirus; Crises; Interacting; People; Rumors; Social Media","adult; article; controlled study; Coronavirinae; government; human; human experiment; Internet; nonhuman; prophylaxis; questionnaire; social media; social responsibility; young adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087707334

We sought to understand whether webpages with chemical information are ""understandable and not misleading to a lay person.""Methods Participants were a national probability sample of US adults and adolescents (n=1441, 18% smokers). In an online experiment, we randomly assigned participants to view one of the developed webpages (chemical names only, names with quantity ranges, names with visual risk indicators) or no webpage in phase one (between subjects). Participants completed a survey assessing knowledge, misunderstanding, perceived likelihood, perceived severity of health effects from smoking and quit intentions (smokers only). In phase two (within subjects), participants viewed all three webpage formats and reported webpage perceptions (clarity, usability, usefulness) and perceived impact (affect, elaboration, perceived effectiveness). Results In phase one, viewing any webpage led to more knowledge of chemicals (48%-54% vs 28% no webpage, ps<0.001) and health harms (77% vs 67% no webpage, ps<0.001). When exposed to any webpage, 5%-23% endorsed misunderstandings that some cigarettes are safer than others. Webpage format did not affect knowledge or reduce misunderstandings. Viewing any webpage led to higher perceived likelihood of experiencing health effects from smoking (p<0.001) and, among smokers, greater intentions to quit smoking (p=0.04). In phase two, where participants viewed all formats, a visual risk indicator led to the highest perceived impact. Conclusions Knowledge of chemicals and health effects can increase after viewing a website. Yet, websites may not correct the misunderstanding that some cigarettes are safer. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

The highly digital time-based architecture employs a single voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), counter, and digital feedback loop for the readout of an external single-ended highly nonlinear resistive sensor, such as an NTC thermistor. In addition to the inherent first-order noise shaping due to the oscillator, the second loop in SMASH configuration creates second-order noise shaping. Fabricated in 180-nm CMOS, the readout circuit achieves 16.1 bit of resolution for 1-ms conversion time and consumes only 171μ W, resulting in an excellent 2.4-pJ/c.s.

Multiple prototype chip samples have been measured in a temperature-controlled environment from -40 °C to 125 °C for the readout of commercial external NTC thermistors. A maximum temperature inaccuracy of 0.3 °C is achieved with only one-point trimming at room temperature.

In the current study, we propose a new approach using a digital workflow and 3-dimensional printing to fabricate clear aligner NAM devices. Methods: A polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) impression of an infant with a unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (UCLP) is acquired and poured, and the stone model is scanned with an intraoral scanner. The stereolithography file is digitized, and the alveolar segments are digitally segmented and moved to the desired final position. The total distance moved is divided into a sequence of 1-1.5 mm increments, creating a series of digital models. The models are 3-dimensionally printed along with button templates to allow free form positioning of the button on each model. A Vacuform machine (Taglus, Mumbai, India) was used to fabricate a 0.040-in aligner for each stage. Results: We present 1 case that was treated successfully with this approach. Appointments for the NAM adjustments were primarily to monitor progress and counseling with less time spent adjusting the appliance. The appointment length was reduced by over 30 minutes. Benefits of the aligner are improved fit, more precise increments of activation, reduced chairside time, and potentially minimized number of visits. Conclusions: NAM custom aligners may provide similar benefits to the traditional approach while reducing the burden of care by reducing the number of visits and appointment duration. Further studies with a sample and longitudinal observations are needed to investigate the benefits of the proposed digital approach. © 2020 American Association of Orthodontists",,"cleft lip; cleft palate; human; India; infant; nose; preoperative care; removable orthodontic appliance; workflow; Cleft Lip; Cleft Palate; Humans; India; Infant; Nose; Orthodontic Appliances, Removable; Preoperative Care; Workflow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088214781

The interface utilizes duty-cycling to reduce the static power consumption of resistive bridge sensors, which are commonly used in implantable, wearable, and internet of things (IoT) applications, such as intracranial pressure (ICP) sensing and blood pressure (BP) monitoring. The proposed interface uses a revised version of the pseudo-pseudo differential (PPD) topology with the ping-pong technique to reduce the complexity of traditional fully-differential counterparts. A proof-of-concept prototype has been fabricated in 0.35-μ m CMOS and occupies an active area of 0.48 mm2. It achieves 9.13 effective number of bits (ENOB) at 3.72 kHz sampling rate and improvement of more than 50 dB in the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) by employing the ping-pong technique. It reduces the power consumption of a 5-k\Omega Wheatstone bridge by 99.6% compared to a traditional interface, down to 2.53~μ w at 1.8 V supply.

Methods: YouTube™ (www.YouTube.com) was searched using “vaccines” as a keyword. Videos in French with at least 10,000 views were identified. For each video, specific descriptive information including the opinion on vaccination was identified. To study the anti-vaccine reaction linked to a change in French policy on vaccination, the main arguments used in videos with negative opinions on vaccination uploaded in 2017 and 2018 were also collected. Results: We identified 166 videos: 120 (72.2%) were considered anti-vaccine videos and 46 (27.8%) were pro-vaccine; 92 (55%) were uploaded between 2017 and 2018. The anti-vaccine videos had been viewed 5,129,215 times and the pro-vaccine videos 2,371,048 times. The three most widely used anti-vaccination arguments were in regard to side effects (75.8%), pharmaceutical lobbying (61.3%), and the presence of adjuvants (51.6%). Conclusion: Health professionals should be aware of the widely disseminated vaccination misinformation available on the Internet. Health professionals and health authorities must invest in these platforms, perhaps in collaboration with popular channels, to inform users accurately and to refute arguments put forward by anti-vaccine videos.

The paper focuses on the number of news features by period and by disaster and analyzes related words based on big data. The results of the analysis are as follows. First, in the initial response phase, keywords to identify accurate sources of actual broadcast contents, fake news, social networking service (SNS), etc. were also ranked in the top 20. Second, in the active response phase, when the number of confirmed persons and the government’s countermeasures were announced, more than 100 COVID-19-related articles were issued, and the related words increased rapidly from the initial response stage. Therefore, the fact that COVID-19 has been expressed as a keyword indicates that our society is watching with great interest in the government’s response to the disease. © 2020 by the authors.

These rates may be influenced by limited diffusion of evidence-based research and guidelines from the scientific community (SC). As recently highlighted by the National Academy of Sciences, there is a need for the SC to diffuse its findings to the public more effectively online, as means to counteract the spread of misinformation. In response to this call, we gathered data from Twitter for one month from major breastfeeding hashtags resulting in an interconnected social network (n = 3,798 users). We then identified 59 influencers who disproportionately influenced information flow using social network analysis. These influencers were from the SC (e.g. academics, researchers, health care practitioners), as well as interested citizens (IC) and companies. We then conducted an ego-network analysis of influencer networks, developed ego maps, and compared diffusion metrics across the SC, IC and company influencers. We also qualitatively analyzed their tweets (n = 711) to understand the type of information being diffused. SC influencers were the least efficient communicators. Although having the highest tweeting activity (80% of tweets), they did not reach more individuals compared to IC and companies (two-step ego size: 220± 99, 188 ± 124, 169 ± 97 respectively, P = 0.28). Content analysis of tweets suggest IC are more active than the SC in diffusing evidence-based breastfeeding knowledge, with 35% of their tweets around recent research findings compared to only 12% by the SC. Nonetheless, in terms of outreach to the general public, the two-step networks of SC influences were more heterogenous than ICs (55.7 ± 5.07, 50.9 ± 12.0, respectively, P<0.001). Collectively, these findings suggest SC influencers may possess latent potential to diffuse research and evidence- based practices. However, the research suggests specific ways to enhance diffusion.

For several reasons, the widely discussed–and potentially harmful–phenomena related to the emancipation of radical right populist online counterpublics have proved difficult to control. First of all, using exclusionary and antagonistic rhetoric or spreading disinformation is not illegal, which makes policing it ineffective. Second, journalistic scrutiny tends to increase the salience of radical right agendas without significantly curbing their appeal. Third, social media companies have passed down responsibility for monitoring extremism on their platforms to users. As an option, it has been suggested that users could organize to push potentially harmful content to the margins of online publics. The study reveals that the materiality of online anti-immigration action allows it to be monitored by anti-racist activists to a certain extent, and that online action aimed at resisting online radical right activism ranges from civil counter-arguing and pursuing of deliberation to anti-racist hate speech and naming-and-shaming campaigns. There are notable caveats that undermine the efficacy and viability of civic monitoring as a means of watching over radical right populist online action. The main problems are related to the connective and potentially anti-populist nature of the civic monitoring–allowing it to be counter-surveilled and used as fuel for populist online communication–and potential danger and harm to the activists involved. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","activism; anti-racism; populism; radical right; Social media; surveillance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060613124

Research shows that, in social media, falsehood is shared far more than evidence-based information. However, there is less research analyzing the circulation of false and evidence-based information during health emergencies. Thus, the present study aims at shedding new light on the type of tweets that circulated on Twitter around the COVID-19 outbreak for two days, in order to analyze how false and true information was shared. To that end, 1000 tweets have been analyzed. Results show that false information is tweeted more but retweeted less than science-based evidence or fact-checking tweets, while science-based evidence and fact-checking tweets capture more engagement than mere facts.

The present survey was conducted to explore the sources of information /misinformation for healthcare professionals from India. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey using snowballing technique was conducted from 24 Mar to 10 Apr 2020. The questionnaire was pretested and developed using standard techniques. It was circulated among medical students and physicians. Data were analysed using the STATA software. Results: Data of 758 participants were analysed. A total of 255 (33.6%) medical students, 335 (44.2%) nonspecialists and 168 (22.1%) specialists participated. The most common source of formal and informal information was official government websites and online news, respectively. A total of 517 (68.2%) participants accepted receiving misinformation. Social media and family and friends were the most common sources of misinformation. Seventy-two percent of participants agreed that spread of information helped to contain COVID-19, but more than that 75% agreed to having received inaccurate information. Seventy-four percent of respondents felt the need for regulation of information during such times; 26% and 33% felt that information about COVID-19 made them feel uncomfortable and distracts routine decision-making, respectively, and 50% felt it was difficult to differentiate correct from incorrect information about COVID-19. Conclusion: The study explored the sources of information and misinformation and found a high prevalence of misinformation, especially from social media. We suggest the need to better manage the flow of information so that it can be an effective weapon against SARS-CoV2. There is a need for doctors to adapt to the changing times of infodemics accompanying pandemics. © 2020","COVID-19; Infodemic; Misinformation; Pandemic; SARS-CoV2","adult; aged; Article; clinical decision making; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; demography; family; female; friend; health care personnel; human; India; information dissemination; male; medical information; medical student; middle aged; misinformation; online monitoring; open ended questionnaire; pandemic; prevalence; questionnaire; social media; socioeconomics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085573221

To date, there is limited evidence on how this infodemic may influence psychobehavioral responses to the crisis. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the psychobehavioral responses to the COVID-19 outbreak and examine their associations with mass and social media exposure. Methods: A cross-sectional study among medical and health sciences students from the Fujian Medical University in Fuzhou, China, was conducted between April 6-22, 2020. Results: A total of 2086 completed responses were received. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that four constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM)-higher perception of susceptibility (odds ratio [OR] 1.44; 95% CI 1.07-1.94), severity (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.10-1.59), self-efficacy (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.21-2.15), and perceived control or intention to carry out prevention measures (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.09-1.59)-were significantly associated with a higher mass media exposure score, whereas only three constructs-higher perception of severity (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.19-1.72), self-efficacy (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.38-2.48), and perceived control or intention to carry out prevention measures (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.08-1.58)-were significantly associated with a higher social media exposure score. Lower emotional consequences and barriers to carry out prevention measures were also significantly associated with greater mass and social media exposure. Our findings on anxiety levels revealed that 38.1% (n=795; 95% CI 36.0-40.2) of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. A lower anxiety level was significantly associated with higher mass and social media exposure in the univariable analyses; however, the associations were not significant in the multivariable analyses. Conclusions: In essence, both mass and social media are useful means of disseminating health messages and contribute to the betterment of psychobehavioral responses to COVID-19. Our findings stress the importance of the credibility of information shared through mass and social media outlets and viable strategies to counter misinformation during a pandemic. © 2020 Yulan Lin, Zhijian Hu, Haridah Alias, Li Ping Wong.","China; COVID-19; Mass media; Medical students; Psychobehavioral; Social media","adult; advertising; anxiety; Article; China; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional study; disease duration; disease severity; family income; female; Health Belief Model; human; major clinical study; male; mass communication; mass medium; medical student; pilot study; publication; questionnaire; rural area; social media; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; young adult; adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; epidemic; epidemiology; pandemic; social media; virus pneumonia; Adolescent; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Mass Media; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media; Students, Medical; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088676709

A common countermeasure against cyber-epidemics is to disable a small subset of suspected social connections or accounts to effectively contain the epidemics. An example is the recent shutdown of 125,000 ISIS-related Twitter accounts. Despite many proposed methods to identify such a subset, none are scalable enough to provide high-quality solutions in nowadays' billion-size networks. To this end, we investigate the Spread Interdiction problems that seek the most effective links (or nodes) for removal under the well-known Linear Threshold model. We propose novel CPU-GPU methods that scale to networks with billions of edges, yet possess rigorous theoretical guarantee on the solution quality. At the core of our methods is an O(1)O(1)-space out-of-core algorithm to generate a new type of random walks, called Hitting Self-avoiding Walks (\mathsf{HSAW}HSAWs). Such a low memory requirement enables handling of big networks and, more importantly, hiding latency via scheduling of millions of threads on GPUs. Comprehensive experiments on real-world networks show that our algorithms provide much higher quality solutions and are several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the art. Comparing to the (single-core) CPU counterpart, our GPU implementations achieve significant speedup factors up to 177x on a single GPU and 338x on a GPU pair. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","GPUs; self-avoiding walks; Spread interdiction","Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Social networking (online); GPU implementation; High-quality solutions; Linear threshold models; Orders of magnitude; Out-of-core algorithms; Real-world networks; Self avoiding walk; Theoretical guarantees; Epidemiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069645231

Thus, automatic debunking of rumors is of great importance to keep social media a healthy environment. While facing a dubious claim, people often dispute its truthfulness sporadically in their posts containing various cues, which can form useful evidence with long-distance dependencies. In this work, we propose to learn discriminative features from microblog posts by following their non-sequential propagation structure and generate more powerful representations for identifying rumors. For modeling non-sequential structure, we first represent the diffusion of microblog posts with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how a claim in the original post is transmitted and developed over time. We then present a bottom-up and a top-down tree-structured models based on Recursive Neural Networks (RvNN) for rumor representation learning and classification, which naturally conform to the message propagation process in microblogs. To enhance the rumor representation learning, we reveal that effective rumor detection is highly related to finding evidential posts, e.g., the posts expressing specific attitude towards the veracity of a claim, as an extension of the previous RvNN-based detection models that treat every post equally. For this reason, we design discriminative attention mechanisms for the RvNN-based models to selectively attend on the subset of evidential posts during the bottom-up/top-down recursive composition. Experimental results on four datasets collected from real-world microblog platforms confirm that (1) our RvNN-based models achieve much better rumor detection and classification performance than state-of-the-art approaches; (2) the attention mechanisms for focusing on evidential posts can further improve the performance of our RvNN-based method; and (3) our approach possesses superior capacity on detecting rumors at a very early stage. © 2020 ACM.","neural attention; propagation tree; recursive neural networks; Rumor detection and classification; social media","Backpropagation; Classification (of information); Forestry; Learning systems; Social networking (online); Attention mechanisms; Classification performance; Discriminative features; Healthy environments; Long-distance dependencies; Recursive neural networks; Sequential structure; State-of-the-art approach; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089276667

To answer these questions, we conducted twelve interviews with some of the individuals behind the accounts and descriptively analyzed 43,569 tweets generated by these 102 accounts during the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. We discovered that not all accounts were not actually being run by agency employees, and that the account administrators had goals of creating a network of “resistance” by sharing scientific information, correcting misinformation, and contributing to the news cycle.

However, researchers have rarely investigated their diffusion in non-western contexts. This study aims to systematically examine the content and network structure of rumor-related discussions around genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on Chinese social media. Design/methodology/approach: This study identified 21,837 rumor-related posts of GMOs on Weibo, one of China's most popular social media platforms. An approach combining social network analysis and content analysis was employed to classify user attitudes toward rumors, measure the level of homophily of their attitudes and examine the nature of their interactions. Findings: Though a certain level of homophily existed in the interaction networks, referring to the observed echo chamber effect, Weibo also served as a public forum for GMO discussions in which cross-cutting ties between communities existed. A considerable amount of interactions emerged between the pro- and anti-GMO camps, and most of them involved providing or requesting information, which could mitigate the likelihood of opinion polarization. Moreover, this study revealed the declining role of traditional opinion leaders and pointed toward the need for alternative strategies for efficient fact-checking. Originality/value: In general, the findings of this study suggested that microblogging platforms such as Weibo can function as public forums for discussing GMOs that expose users to ideologically cross-cutting viewpoints.

Social media platforms police their content in various ways. Primarily they rely on crowdsourced 'flags': users signal to the platform that a specific news item might be misleading and, if they raise enough of them, the item will be fact-checked. However, real-world data show that the most flagged news sources are also the most popular and - supposedly - reliable ones. In this paper, we show that this phenomenon can be explained by the unreasonable assumptions that current content policing strategies make about how the online social media environment is shaped. The most realistic assumption is that confirmation bias will prevent a user from flagging a news item if they share the same political bias as the news source producing it. We show, via agent-based simulations, that a model reproducing our current understanding of the social media environment will necessarily result in the most neutral and accurate sources receiving most flags. © 2020 The Authors.","content policing; echo chambers; fake news; flagging; social media; social networks","Social networking (online); Agent based simulation; Confirmation bias; News sources; Online social medias; Real-world; Social media; Social media platforms; Crowdsourcing; article; confirmation bias; disinformation; human; simulation; social media; social network",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086354599

But, organising effective campaigns to build social media literacy can be one of the potential measures that can be implemented in order to control the spread of fake news over social media platforms.

Hence, this particular study can support Government of India to make decisions to roll out regulatory measures to control the spread of fake news through social media, which is still on the red tape. © 2020 Amity University.","Fake news; National policy; Regulatory body; Self-regulation; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088523068

The working group ‘Drugs and COVID-19’ was composed of a scientific council, an editorial team, and experts in the field. The first questions were posted online during the first evening of home-confinement in France, March 17, 2020. Six weeks later, 140 Q&As have been posted. Questions on the controversial use of hydroxychloroquine and to a lesser extent concerning azithromycin have been the most consulted Q&As. Q&As have been consulted 226 014 times in 41 days. This large visibility was obtained through an early communication on Twitter, Facebook, traditional print, and web media. In addition, an early communication through the French Ministry of Health and the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety ANSM had a large impact in terms of daily number of views.

To investigate fake news during natural disasters, this mixed-methods study examines information patterns and journalistic practices of three news organizations during the 2018 Palu earthquake and tsunami. First, online observations of disaster-related fake news cases on social media provide insights into how fake news was handled by three types of news media. The results show that when fake news concerned factual scientific evidence, news organizations unanimously used the government statements to debunk disinformation. In contrast, political or religious fake news had long lifecycles of polarized debates between pro-government groups and opponents. Using the Hierarchy-of Influences Model, in-depth interviews showed that individual-level journalistic professionalism mattered when tackling fake news reports, with some local practices differing from Western journalism approaches. At the routine level, news professionals treated the government as the authority to debunk controversial, high-risk fake news by presenting news only after official clarifications, while independent media tended to present balanced reports with diverse views. Additionally, interviewees revealed that organizational policies in relation to media types greatly influenced the handling of fake news practices in Indonesian newsrooms. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Fake news; hierarchy of influences; Indonesia; natural disaster; news practices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084791438

It consists of three current transformers (CTs) and three potential transformers (PTs). Cost of IEMS increases with improvement in its accuracy class. The contribution of this article is that, it adduces design and development of high accuracy class and cost-effective IEMS. To accomplish this, a novel Industrial Energy Measurement-Error Compensation Unit (IEM-ECU) is proposed. To realize this, first, the three different accuracy classes, viz. 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 IEMS are fabricated in the laboratory. Characteristics of every CT and PT are determined. Second, the proposed error correction algorithm is implemented in real time to improve errors of IEMS. Finally, the experimental results are depicted in LabVIEW for mixed class of CTs and PTs. Various experimental tests have been performed and results are validated by comparing the results obtained from digital storage oscilloscope. These results clearly illustrate that the proposed IEM-ECU not only convert lower accuracy class IEMS to higher accuracy class but it also gives flexibility to use available class of CTs and/or PTs, if required under contingency. Thereby, considerable cost savings can be achieved as the performance of lower accuracy class matches with the higher accuracy class. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","accuracy class; correction coefficient; current transformers (CTs); digital energy meter (DEM); Industrial Energy Measurement System (IEMS); Industrial Energy Measurement-Error Compensation Unit (IEM-ECU); LabVIEW; phase angle error; potential transformers (PTs); ratio error","Cathode ray oscilloscopes; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Electric transformers; Error correction; Measurement errors; Cost effective; Design and Development; Electrical energy; Error correction algorithms; Experimental test; Industrial consumers; Industrial energy; Potential Transformers (PTs); Error compensation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092117788

Motivated by recent attempts in this direction, we consider the problem faced by a social-media platform that is observing the sharing actions of a sequence of rational agents and is dynamically choosing whether to conduct an inspection (i.e., a “fact-check”) of an article whose validity is ex ante unknown. We first characterize the agents' inspection and sharing actions and establish that, in the absence of any platform intervention, the agents' news-sharing process is prone to the proliferation of fabricated content, even when the agents are intent on sharing only truthful news. We then study the platform's inspection problem. We find that because the optimal policy is adapted to crowdsource inspection from the agents, it exhibits features that may appear a priori nonobvious; most notably, we show that the optimal inspection policy is nonmonotone in the ex ante probability that the article being shared is fake. We also investigate the effectiveness of the platform's policy in mitigating the detrimental impact of fake news on the agents' learning environment. We demonstrate that in environments characterized by a low (high) prevalence of fake news, the platform's policy is more effective when the rewards it collects from content sharing are low relative to the penalties it incurs from the sharing of fake news (when the rewards it collects from content sharing are high in absolute terms).

Insights into how to debunk this type of misinformation can especially be crucial for public health crises. To identify corrective information strategies that increase awareness and trigger actions during infectious disease outbreaks, an online experiment (N = 700) was conducted, using a U.S. sample. After initial misinformation exposure, participants’ exposure to corrective information type (simple rebuttal vs. factual elaboration) and source (government health agency vs. news media vs. social peer) was varied, including a control group without corrective information. Results show that, if corrective information is present rather than absent, incorrect beliefs based on misinformation are debunked and the exposure to factual elaboration, compared to simple rebuttal, stimulates intentions to take protective actions. Moreover, government agency and news media sources are found to be more successful in improving belief accuracy compared to social peers. The observed mediating role of crisis emotions reveals the mechanism underlying the effects of corrective information.

This study aimed to examine the strengths and weaknesses of English baby-box schemes as experienced by healthcare providers and parents. Methods: An independent mixed-methods evaluation was conducted via telephone interviews and online surveys with healthcare providers and parents in all 7/9 NHS regions of England where baby-box schemes were established 2016-2019. Participants responded to requests circulated electronically by NHS Research & Design Departments, and infant health organisations in England. The objectives were to identify how parents and healthcare providers understood and experienced baby-box schemes implemented in England to date, and to produce recommendations for organisations considering involvement in future schemes. Results: Baby-box schemes changed over time, and were complex to run and monitor. Both parents and practitioners were misinformed about their purpose and origins. Partnerships with a commercial box-provider reduced the investment needed to run a baby-box scheme, and offered potential benefits to staff regarding engagement with families via online education and face-to-face contact around handover of boxes, but carried unforeseen costs. Of particular concern was the box-provider's access to parent personal details being promoted by NHS staff and parents' lack of awareness; the hidden costs incurred by NHS facilities of running a box-scheme; and the costs incurred by parents in accessing their 'free' box. Sixteen recommendations are proposed for healthcare providers and organisations considering commercial-health-provider baby-box partnerships in future. Conclusions: Many assumptions exist about the origins and purpose of baby-boxes; this misinformation needs correcting, especially as it relates to infant death reduction and safe infant sleep. Baby-box schemes take multiple forms from those motivated by social welfare to those motivated by commercial profit. The English experience of partnership schemes between healthcare facilities and commercial box-providers reveals some success stories, along with multiple points of ambiguity, unanticipated difficulty, and concerns for infant safety. © 2020 The Author(s).","Baby boxes; Health service partnerships, parent education; Infant health; SIDS and SUDI","ambiguity; Article; awareness; baby box scheme; child; child health; child safety; clinical evaluation; death; England; experience; female; health care facility; health care need; health care organization; health practitioner; health program; health survey; human; infant; infant mortality; male; misinformation; parent counseling; professional practice; profit; sleep; social welfare; telephone interview; work engagement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083335810

These can be grouped into three goals and two constraints: countering misinformation, establishing benevolence, and establishing competence while maintaining integrity and clarity. Empathic failure and burnout both emerged as factors that impair establishing benevolence. We discuss implications for community-level science literacy and for preparing scientists for “bounded engagement with publics”. © The Author(s) 2020.","nutrition; online communities; outreach; science literacy; social media; trustworthiness; vaccines","expert witness; information dissemination; interview; nutritional science; procedures; vaccination; Expert Testimony; Information Dissemination; Interviews as Topic; Nutritional Sciences; Vaccination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078325695

There are significant public doubts in expediency of investments in renewables in place. Our paper studies the factors related to the public opinion on renewables using a reasonable and representative sample of respondents (N = 1026) from one of the EU Member States, the Czech Republic, via a set of ordinal regression analyses with spline correction for ordinal predictors. Our results suggest that the population of the Czech Republic is split in half in its trust in renewables as a substitute to traditional energy sources. In addition, our results show that the opinions on renewables in the Czech Republic are significantly related to personal concerns on environmental protection and worries about use of nuclear energy. Moreover, we find that traditional mass media is not statistically significant, even though internet news channels and social media were statistically related to the opinions (negatively and positively, respectively). The comparison of the responses with respect to the frequency of following social media support the hypothesis of the media bubble. The empirical results indicate that public opinions on renewables are likely to be built on the information sources vulnerable to hoaxes, bubbles, and misinformation. We conclude that more media presentation on RES is needed and make some practical suggestions for the stakeholders, journalists, and relevant policymakers. © 2020 by the authors.

Methods: Using agent-based models, we considered the effects of such misinformation on a norovirus outbreak, and some methods for countering the possible impacts of “good” and “bad” health advice. The work explicitly models spread of physical disease and information (both online and offline) as two separate but interacting processes. The models have multiple stochastic elements; repeat model runs were made to identify parameter values that most consistently produced the desired target baseline scenario. Next, parameters were found that most consistently led to a scenario when outbreak severity was clearly made worse by circulating poor quality disease prevention advice. Strategies to counter “fake” health news were tested. Results: Reducing bad advice to 30% of total information or making at least 30% of people fully resistant to believing in and sharing bad health advice were effective thresholds to counteract the negative impacts of bad advice during a norovirus outbreak. Conclusion: How feasible it is to achieve these targets within communication networks (online and offline) should be explored. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Agent-based-models; Fake news; Filter bubbles; Norovirus; Outbreak","agent based model; Article; disease severity; disease transmission; disinformation; epidemic; human; infection prevention; information dissemination; mass communication; nonbiological model; norovirus infection; prevalence; universal precaution; access to information; calicivirus infection; consumer health information; health literacy; information service; Internet; interpersonal communication; Norovirus; organization and management; physiology; system analysis; virology; Access to Information; Caliciviridae Infections; Communication; Consumer Health Information; Disease Outbreaks; Health Literacy; Humans; Information Dissemination; Information Services; Internet; Norovirus; Public Reporting of Healthcare Data; Systems Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078994482

A huge number and a large diversity of cosmetic products known across the globe are conquering the Saudi markets. The omnipresence of cosmetic products and their identification through specific trademarks, known as cosmetic trademarks (CMT) necessitated their protection in the Saudi markets. Over the years, the protection of CTM has not been studied and analyzed in Saudi Arabia, thus proving the existence of an intellectual gap that can be filled by an in-depth trademark study. The primary objective of this study is to expand the scope of trademark's regulation and protection by incorporating CTM through the presentation of facts that answer questions regarding the laws that govern CTM and the ways of obtaining their protection. Saudi markets are rich with genuine high-quality cosmetic products with globally known CTM. However, the situation has since changed because of the smuggling of fake and cheap imports from different countries. Counterfeit cosmetic products constitute a huge portion of the products in most markets of the region, which made the Saudi legislature eager to come up with specific rules and regulations to combat trademark counterfeiting that is affecting the image of trademarks and misleading consumers by offering lower-quality products and services. The government has seized over 84 million fake goods since 2015 under the rules of trademark's protection, a large portion of which includes food and cosmetic products. This study will reflect how the protection of CTM applies within the limits of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and analyze the different means of CTM's enforcement and it will adopt for that purpose a mix of qualitative and quantitative method. The qualitative method is demonstrated in library research using primary and secondary sources, while the quantitative method is demonstrated in an online question-based survey that was randomly distributed. The survey was conducted between 24 October 2019 and 5 November 2019 with 126 participants from both genders living in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The purpose of the survey was to know the most purchased cosmetic products and the consumer awareness regarding the impact of cosmetic trademark preference in the choice of product. From another end, the survey aims to evaluate consumer behavior regarding counterfeited cosmetic products to determine whether it participate in the spread of counterfeited cosmetic products and cosmetic trademark imitation or not, in addition to consumers awareness of their rights in that matter. This survey will pave the way to understand the environment of the CTM's enforcement.","Board of Grievances; Consumer Protection; Cosmetic Trademarks; Counterfeit; Enforcement; GCC Trademark Law; Penalties; Well-Known Trademark",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096616910

Of interest here, the sliding bubble velocity is included in a mechanistic boiling heat transfer model and it varies with the bubble volume, location of the nucleation site, generation frequency of the bubble, etc. In order to predict the sliding velocity of the bubbles generated under the various conditions, a model developed based on the physical mechanism is required. This paper presents experimental techniques and measurement results for observing vapour bubble sliding phenomena. A specially devised flexible heater was fabricated and attached on a rod in order to control the bubble generation location. With the heater and a digital image processing technique, accurate measurement of the bubble volume and velocity became facilitated. Through the experiment, the life cycles of a single bubble was clearly visualised including the birth, departure, sliding, and lift-off. The force balance model which includes the curvature effect in cylindrical coordinate was derived to predict the sliding bubble velocity in the experiment. The equation of the model was based on the balance of circumferential directional forces acting on a sliding bubble with a correction of the local liquid velocity to consider the wake generated by a preceding bubble. The force balance analysis showed that the dominant forces are the buoyancy, quasi-steady drag, and added mass forces. The proposed model was validated by comparing the predicted bubble velocity with the experimental data and it predicted the bubble velocity with satisfactory accuracy. In addition, the force balance analysis found that the sliding bubble velocity correlates well with the bubble generation location when it was non-dimensionalised in a form of Froude number. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Boiling heat transfer; Bubble velocity; Force balance; Heat partitioning model; Horizontal tube; Sliding bubble","Bubbles (in fluids); Forecasting; Heat transfer; Image processing; Life cycle; Location; Boiling heat transfer; Bubble velocities; Force balances; Heat partitioning; Horizontal tubes; Sliding bubble; Velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078873716

The paper will examine what the professional role of Facebook is regarding its information/communication practices and then demonstrate that Facebook is essentially a media company and not merely a “platform,” therefore liable to the same normative responsibilities as other media companies. Design/methodology/approach: Applying the dual obligation information theory (DOIT), a normative information and communication theory that applies generally to all media companies that disseminate and share information, the paper demonstrates that Facebook’s role of mediating and curating the information of its users places upon it a normative editing responsibility, to ensure both the preventive detection and corrective editing of fake news, as well as other forms of misinformation disseminated on its platform. Finally, applying a philosophical model of media corruption the paper will demonstrate that Facebook’s role in the Cambridge Analytica case was not only unethical but moreover, constituted media corruption. Findings: The paper concludes that Facebook’s media corruption illustrated in the Cambridge Analytica case is not a one-off case but the result of a systemic and inherent conflict of interest between its business model of selling users’ information to advertisers and its normative media role rendering the conflict of interest between those two roles conducive to media corruption. Originality/value: The paper's originality is twofold. It demonstrates that Facebook is a media company normatively accountable on the basis of an original theory the DOIT and moreover, on the basis of an original media corruption theory its actions in the Cambridge Analytica case constituted media corruption. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dual obligation information theory ‘DOIT’; Ethics; Facebook; Media corruption; Myth of Gyges; Plato",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081385060

Our findings indicate that, irrespective of the source, multimodal disinformation is considered slightly more credible than textual disinformation. Fact checkers can help to overcome the potential harmful consequences of disinformation.

This study aimed to identify pharmacist activity in SM and explore the potential for pharmacist contributions using SM. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted in four cities in Indonesia. The investigators collaborated with a local pharmacist association to select a wide range of pharmacists as participants. The discussions were audiotaped, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Forty-one pharmacists participated in the FGDs. Four broad themes were identified: pharmacist use of SM, current initiatives using SM, public acceptance, and opportunities for role expansion. WhatsApp was the most used SM and had meaningful contribution to spread information and change a patient's behavior. Participants used SM mainly for personal purposes, but when it came to pharmacy and health issues, they were among the first to be contacted by patients or to counter misleading information in SM. A number of participants actively used SM for health promotion in form of sharing health information, promoting use of medicines, providing drug reminders, and encouraging compliance to medication. The public had a high trust to information provided by pharmacists in SM. Although participants believed pharmacists can play a role in educating patients and influencing the health of the communities, they considered being active in SM as burdensome, time consuming, and potential for lawsuit. SM has become a venue for pharmacists to improve the health of the people. Several unique features in SM may facilitate pharmacist contributions; however, whether pharmacists continue to undertake such initiative cannot be guaranteed. © 2019 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","health care; pharmacist; social media","adult; Article; behavior; clinical article; controlled study; female; health care; health promotion; human; Indonesia; Indonesian; law suit; male; medical information; patient education; pharmacist; public health; social media; thematic analysis; information processing; pharmacist; procedures; professional standard; public health; Adult; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Male; Pharmacists; Professional Role; Public Health; Social Media",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076278604

In this study, the rumor diffusion in the homogeneous and heterogeneous social networks has been explored, introducing the concept of an anti-rumor spreading agent as the mitigator. The study consists of four types of individuals within the population, namely, spreaders, mitigators, ignorants, and stiflers. To model the interactions among the aforesaid populations, five mathematical models have been proposed for the rumor diffusion process in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. The proposed SMIR model has been solved using Runge-Kutta fourth-order method and then the model has been extended into a fuzzy environment to deal with the inherent uncertainties. The spreading of a rumor is a socio-psychological phenomenon which may contain delay in the process. To investigate this, the SMIR model has been transformed into a delayed SMIR model. In the heterogeneous environment, the SMIR model has been extended in a small world and scale-free networks. The results obtained are analyzed in all the cases and found that mitigator plays a critical role to control the spread of rumor in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Epidemic; Rumor; Scale-free network; Small world network; Uncertainty","Complex networks; Small-world networks; Epidemic; Fourth-order method; Fuzzy environments; Heterogeneous environments; Rumor; Social networking sites; Spread of informations; Uncertainty; Runge Kutta methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074491847

This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of this approach in a pig model. Materials and Methods: Five 4-month-old pigs were included for mandibular bone marrow aspiration and MSC isolation. Triple-layer MSC sheets were then fabricated and utilized using culture-expanded MSCs. Four weeks after bone marrow aspiration, subperiosteal pockets were created on the labial symphyseal surface, followed by transplantation of autogenous MSC sheets to one randomly chosen side with the other side (control) receiving no transplantation. Six weeks after the surgery, the pigs were euthanized and the specimens from both sides were collected for computed tomography (CT) and histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Measurements between the experimental and control sides were compared using paired t tests. Results: MSC sheet fabrication and transplantation were reliably conducted. The labial cortical bone thickness increased significantly with MSC sheet transplantation by an average of 2 mm (p = 0.0001). The average measurements of mineral apposition rate and cell proliferation at the cell sheet side tended to be higher than the control side although the differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1–0.2). Tissue mineral density measurements from CT images and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) measurements from histologic images were identical between the two sides (p > 0.5). Conclusion: These data provide a proof of concept that autologous MSC sheets may be transplanted to the subperiosteal region of the mandibular symphysis to stimulate local surface bone growth.

In order to investigate the crack closure behavior, digital image correlation (DIC) method was applied to measure the full-field displacement and strain fields around the crack tip. The deformation carrier (speckle) was fabricated on the polished specimen surface with ZrO2 powders having a good high-temperature resistance, and the speckle patterns were recorded during the fatigue test by SEM. In consideration of the distortion of SEM images, the unabridged model and the bicubic model were used to correct the spatial distortion, and the distortion parameters can be determined by a calibration test. It is shown that the unabridged model makes a better contribution towards improving SEM-DIC measurement accuracy. Based on the deformation field, the mode I stress intensity factor range ΔK and the crack opening displacement (COD) can be calculated for evaluating the crack closure effect. Additionally, the crack propagation was monitored using SEM and optical microscope.

However, they have also become a fertile ground for the spread of false information, particularly regarding the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Best described as an infodemic, there is a great need, now more than ever, for scientific fact-checking and misinformation detection regarding the dangers posed by these tools with regards to COVID-19. In this article, we analyze the credibility of information shared on Twitter pertaining the COVID-19 pandemic. For our analysis, we propose an ensemble-learning-based framework for verifying the credibility of a vast number of tweets. In particular, we carry out analyses of a large dataset of tweets conveying information regarding COVID-19. In our approach, we classify the information into two categories: credible or non-credible. Our classifications of tweet credibility are based on various features, including tweet- and user-level features. We conduct multiple experiments on the collected and labeled dataset. The results obtained with the proposed framework reveal high accuracy in detecting credible and non-credible tweets containing COVID-19 information. © 2013 IEEE.","Classification; COVID-19; machine learning; misinformation; Twitter","Large dataset; Social networking (online); Coronaviruses; Ensemble learning; High-accuracy; Information shared; Labeled dataset; On-line social networks; User levels; Classification (of information)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090957746

The spread of non-scientific information through social media platforms such as Twitter has potential to cause damaging consequences. Situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic provides a favourable environment for misinformation to thrive. The upcoming 5G technology is one of the recent victims of misinformation and fake news and has been plagued with misinformation about the effects of its radiation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories linking the cause of the pandemic to 5G technology have resonated with a section of people leading to outcomes such as destructive attacks on 5G towers. The analysis of the social network data can help to understand the nature of the information being spread and identify the commonly occurring themes in the information. The natural language processing (NLP) and the statistical analysis of the social network data can empower policymakers to understand the misinformation being spread and develop targeted strategies to counter the misinformation. In this paper, NLP based analysis of tweets linking COVID-19 to 5G is presented. NLP models including Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), sentiment analysis (SA) and social network analysis (SNA) were applied for the analysis of the tweets and identification of topics. An understanding of the topic frequencies, the inter-relationships between topics and geographical occurrence of the tweets allows identifying agencies and patterns in the spread of misinformation and equips policymakers with knowledge to devise counter-strategies.

Through symptoms diagnosis, the study contributes more categories to the previous typology of fake news: “click-bait,” “alarmist talk,” “subjective assumption,” “user-generated content (UGC)-news,” “hearsay,” and “incorrect-data news”. Etiology analysis shows that Chinese fake news is mainly about social life partially because of no previous tradition of verifying daily statements from politicians. Trend predictions reveal that online media, hearsay, and social life-related news of unverified single sources are the main problems which are different from the West and require special attention in the future.

At the same time, however, social media offers a promising avenue to stem the distribution of false claims–as evidenced by real-time corrections, crowdsourced fact-checking, and algorithmic tagging. Despite the growing attempts to correct misinformation on social media, there is still considerable ambiguity regarding the ability to effectively ameliorate the negative impact of false messages. To address this gap, the current study uses a meta-analysis to evaluate the relative impact of social media interventions designed to correct health-related misinformation (k = 24; N = 6,086). Additionally, the meta-analysis introduces theory-driven moderators that help delineate the effectiveness of social media interventions. The mean effect size of attempts to correct misinformation on social media was positive and significant (d = 0.40, 95% CI [0.25, 0.55], p =.0005) and a publication bias could not be excluded. Interventions were more effective in cases where participants were involved with the health topic, as well as when misinformation was distributed by news organizations (vs. peers) and debunked by experts (vs. non-experts). The findings of this meta-analysis can be used not only to depict the current state of the literature but also to prescribe specific recommendations to better address the proliferation of health misinformation on social media. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"adult; article; cell proliferation; effect size; female; human; human experiment; male; meta analysis; misinformation; organization; publication bias; social media",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089192345

This article reports on a small study which attempted to identify the types and sources of COVID-19 misinformation. The authors identified and analysed 1225 pieces of COVID-19 fake news stories taken from fact-checkers, myth-busters and COVID-19 dashboards. The study is significant given the concern raised by the WHO Director-General that ‘we are not just fighting the pandemic, we are also fighting infodemic’. The study concludes that the COVID-19 infodemic is full of false claims, half backed conspiracy theories and pseudoscientific therapies, regarding the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, origin and spread of the virus. Fake news is pervasive in social media, putting public health at risk. The scale of the crisis and ubiquity of the misleading information require that scientists, health information professionals and journalists exercise their professional responsibility to help the general public identify fake news stories.

To achieve this goal, the features of the monitored users were extracted from Twitter, such as social and personal information as well as interaction with content and other users. Subsequently, we performed (i) an offline analysis realized through the use of deep learning techniques and (ii) an online analysis that involved real users in the classification of reliable/unreliable user profiles. The experimental results, validated from a statistical point of view, show which information best enables machines and humans to detect malicious users.

We conducted an online experiment involving a convenient sample of 609 U.S. adult participants with five message conditions: two misinformation messages (one using the conspiracy frame and one using the uncertainty frame), two corresponding two-sided refutational messages, and a control group. Results showed that both conspiracy and uncertainty framed misinformation messages decreased pro-vaccination attitude in comparison to the control. The two refutational messages increased pro-vaccination attitude in comparison to the corresponding misinformation messages. These effects were further mediated by the emotion of anger. Parental status and conspiracy beliefs did not moderate effects of the messages on vaccination attitude.

(b) Which media frame did the online news use most frequently? (c) How did the media frames change during and after the information vacuum?. Methods: Content analysis of news articles that covered MERS rumours during the outbreak has been conducted. Inductive open coding has been performed to investigate what reactions and media frames the news coverages have demonstrated to report the rumour propagation. Sample: The article samples were retrieved for big data analysis from the Big Kinds or the Korea Integrated News Database System (www.bigkinds.or.kr), by using the search terms, “MERS” and “SNS (Social Network Services).” A total of 142 articles have been sampled. Results: The paper found 7 reaction variables and categorized them into 2 risk-reporting media frames: risk-alarming frame(Anxiety, Criticisms and Damage) and risk-mitigating frame (Government, Correction, Remedies and Causes). The paper discovered that anxiety was the most frequently observed reaction variable across all phases. The paper also concluded that there has been a decrease in risk-alarming media frames and an increase in attempts to analyze causes for the rumour propagation (Causes), as the outbreak proceeds to the second phase, when the information vacuum finally ended. Conclusion: By exploring a disease outbreak in which ineffective risk management and absence of official information caused significant problems, the paper underlines the need for systematic risk communication measures, endorsed by effective collaboration among political leadership, media and the public. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","health crisis; information vacuum; MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome); misinformation; risk perception",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083993513

Design/methodology/approach: The partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used for the analysis. Data were drawn from 152 Facebook and WhatsApp users in Nigeria to examine the research model formulated using the uses and gratification theory (UGT). Findings: We found that altruism, instant news sharing, socialisation and self-promotion predicted fake news sharing related to COVID-19 pandemic among social media users in Nigeria. Specifically, altruism was the strongest predictor to fake news sharing behaviour related to COVID-19, followed by instant news sharing and socialisation. On the contrary, entertainment had no association with fake news sharing on COVID-19. Practical implications: We suggest intervention strategies which nudge people to be sceptical of the information they come across on social media. We also recommend healthcare providers and the Nigerian government to provide relevant information on this current pandemic. That is, correct information should be shared widely to the public domain through various conventional and online media. This will lessen the spread of fake news on the concocted cure and prevention tips found online. Originality/value: The salient contributions of this study are as follows: First, it brings to the fore that the desire for self-promotion is associated with fake news sharing on social media; second, it shifts the focus of studies on fake news from detection methods to sharing behaviour, which fuels the uncontrollable spread of falsehood; third, it expands the existing literature on misinformation sharing by demonstrating the user motivation that leads to fake news sharing using the UGT. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Fake news; Fake news sharing; Nigeria; Social media users","Least squares approximations; Motivation; Social networking (online); Design/methodology/approach; Detection methods; Health care providers; Intervention strategy; Partial least square (PLS); Predictive modeling; Structural equation modelling; Uses and gratification theories; Predictive analytics",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095943759

A digital outbreak of disinformation has spread around the COVID-19 pandemic, often referred to as an “infodemic.” Since January 2020, digital media have been both the culprits of and antidotes to misinformation. The first months of the pandemic have shown that countering disinformation online has become as important as ensuring much needed medical equipment and supplies for health workers. For many governments around the world, priority COVID-19 actions included measures such as (a) providing guidance to social media companies on taking down contentious pandemic content (e.g., India); (b) establishing special units to combat disinformation (e.g., EU, UK); and (c) criminalizing malicious coronavirus falsehood, including in relation to public health measures. This article explores the short and potential long-term effects of newly passed legislation in various countries directly targeting COVID-19 disinformation on the media, whether traditional or digital. The early actions enacted under the state-of-emergency carve new directions in negotiating the delicate balance between freedom of expression and online censorship, in particular by imposing limitations on access to information and inducing self-restraint in reporting. Based on comparative legal analysis, this article provides a timely discussion of intended and unintended consequences of such legal responses to the “infodemic,” reflecting on a basic set of safeguards needed to preserve trust in online information. © The Author(s) 2020.","access to information; COVID-19; legislation; online disinformation; online trust",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089136378

For COVID-19, in many parts of the world, such misinformation is circulating through globally popular mobile instant messaging services (MIMS) like WhatsApp and Telegram. Compared to more public social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, these services offer private, intimate, and often encrypted spaces for users to chat with family members and friends, making it difficult for the platform to moderate misinformation on them. Thus, there is an enhanced onus on users of MIMS to curb misinformation by correcting their family and friends within these spaces. Research on understanding how such relational correction occurs in different parts of the globe will need to attend to how the nature of these interpersonal relationships and the cultural dynamics that influence them shape the correction process. Thus, as people increasingly use MIMS to connect with close relations to make sense of this global crisis, studying the issue of misinformation on these services requires us to adopt a relationship-centered and culturally informed approach. © The Author(s) 2020.","COVID-19; misinformation; mobile instant messaging services; WhatsApp",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089276737

Here we use machine learning to quantify COVID-19 content among online opponents of establishment health guidance, in particular vaccinations ('anti-vax'). We find that the anti-vax community is developing a less focused debate around COVID-19 than its counterpart, the pro-vaccination ('pro-vax') community. However, the anti-vax community exhibits a broader range of 'flavors' of COVID-19 topics, and hence can appeal to a broader cross-section of individuals seeking COVID-19 guidance online, e.g. individuals wary of a mandatory fast-tracked COVID-19 vaccine or those seeking alternative remedies. Hence the anti-vax community looks better positioned to attract fresh support going forward than the pro-vax community. This is concerning since a widespread lack of adoption of a COVID-19 vaccine will mean the world falls short of providing herd immunity, leaving countries open to future COVID-19 resurgences. We provide a mechanistic model that interprets these results and could help in assessing the likely efficacy of intervention strategies. Our approach is scalable and hence tackles the urgent problem facing social media platforms of having to analyze huge volumes of online health misinformation and disinformation. © 2013 IEEE.","COVID-19; machine learning; mechanistic model; social computing; topic modeling","E-learning; Health; Vaccines; Community IS; Herd immunities; Intervention strategy; Mechanistic modeling; Social media platforms; Urgent problems; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085551012

This includes the spread of misinformation, which has been documented within the context of the emerging COVID-19 crisis. Understanding the creation, spread and uptake of social media misinformation is of critical importance to public safety. In this descriptive study, we detail Twitter activity regarding spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and claims it increases, or “boosts”, immunity. Spinal manipulation is a common intervention used by many health professions, most commonly by chiropractors. There is no clinical evidence that SMT improves human immunity. Methods: Social media searching software (Talkwalker Quick Search) was used to describe Twitter activity regarding SMT and improving or boosting immunity. Searches were performed for the 3 months and 12 months before March 31, 2020 using terms related to 1) SMT, 2) the professions that most often provide SMT and 3) immunity. From these searches, we determined the magnitude and time course of Twitter activity then coded this activity into content that promoted or refuted a SMT/immunity link. Content themes, high-influence users and user demographics were then stratified as either promoting or refuting this linkage. Results: Twitter misinformation regarding a SMT/immunity link increased dramatically during the onset of the COVID crisis. Activity levels (number of tweets) and engagement scores (likes + retweets) were roughly equal between content promoting or refuting a SMT/immunity link, however, the potential reach (audience) of tweets refuting a SMT/immunity link was 3 times higher than those promoting a link. Users with the greatest influence on Twitter, as either promoters or refuters, were individuals, not institutions or organizations. The majority of tweets promoting a SMT/immunity link were generated in the USA while the majority of refuting tweets originated from Canada. Conclusion: Twitter activity about SMT and immunity increased during the COVID-19 crisis. Results from this work have the potential to help policy makers and others understand the impact of SMT misinformation and devise strategies to mitigate its impact. © The Author(s). 2020 Open Access","Chiropractic; Immunity; Misinformation; Social media; Spinal manipulation; Twitter","Article; Canada; chiropractor; coronavirus disease 2019; descriptive research; disease duration; health practitioner; human; immunity; information processing; misinformation; priority journal; protocol compliance; social media; software; spine manipulation; therapy effect; United States; Betacoronavirus; chiropractic; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; ethics; immunology; information dissemination; interpersonal communication; isolation and purification; pandemic; procedures; public health; secondary immunization; spine manipulation; treatment outcome; virus pneumonia; Coronavirus infection; immunity; immunology; pandemic; physiology; social media; time factor; virus pneumonia; Betacoronavirus; Chiropractic; Communication; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immunity; Immunization, Secondary; Information Dissemination; Manipulation, Spinal; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Social Media; Treatment Outcome; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Immunity; Manipulation, Spinal; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086354426

Hence, the purpose of this study is to shed light on the effectiveness of the crisis response strategies of denial and attack in addressing rumors about consumer privacy when non-profit organizations are targeted on social media. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, a 2 (response type: denial vs attack) × 2 (privacy concerns: low vs high), between-group online experiment was conducted via Qualtrics. Findings: The results indicated that one’s involvement level in the issue determines the effectiveness of the crisis response strategy. Data showed that attacking the source of fake news (as a crisis response) reduces the message’s credibility more than denying fake news. Furthermore, highly involved individuals are more likely to centrally process information and develop positive supportive intentions toward the affected non-profit brand. High issue involvement also predicted organizational and response credibility. Conversely, an attack rebuttal message increased the credibility of the circulated malicious rumors for low involved individuals. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that issue involvement plays a key role in message perceptions of false information regarding consumer privacy in social media. Practical implications: Practically, this study offers insights for organizations that are developing response strategies in the current environment of fake news. Findings from this study suggest that organizations need to consider the degree to which audiences are currently involved in an issue before deciding how aggressively to respond to perpetrators of fake news. Originality/value: The present study examines the intersection of fake news and crisis management in the non-profit sector, with an emphasis on various response strategies and issue involvement.

The commercialization of marijuana has been accompanied by a proliferation of false claims regarding the therapeutic potential of marijuana, which are popularized by several different information sources. To date, no study has examined where US adults get their information regarding marijuana. Objective: To determine the sources of information associated with believing unsupported claims about marijuana. Design: Probability-based online survey Participants: 16,820 adults, with a response rate of about 55% (N = 9003) Main Measures: Most influential sources of information about marijuana and belief of statements consistent with misinformation, for example, smoking marijuana has preventative health benefits, secondhand marijuana smoke or use during pregnancy is completely or somewhat safe, and marijuana is not at all addictive. Key Results: There were 9003 respondents (response rate 55%). Forty-three percent believed unsupported claims about marijuana. The most influential sources of information were health professionals, traditional media, friends/relatives, and social media/internet. Individuals reporting social media or the Internet (1.46 CI [1.30, 1.64]), the marijuana industry (e.g., advertisements, dispensaries) (2.88 CI [2.15, 3.88]), and friends or relatives (1.41 CI[1.26, 1.58]) as the most influential source of information about marijuana were more likely to believe any statement consistent with misinformation about marijuana in comparison with those who reported other sources as most influential. Conclusions: Individuals reporting the most significant source of information regarding marijuana was from social media or the Internet, the marijuana industry, or friends or relatives were more likely to believe unsupported claims about marijuana.

When used correctly, social media is an effective tool to communicate and to share food safety news and good practices. However, there have been reports of fake food safety news shared via social media, fueling panic and resulting in a loss of revenue. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the consumers’ awareness, trust, and usage of social media in communicating food safety news in Malaysia. A questionnaire divided into five sections—(i) demographics, (ii) reaction to food safety news, (iii) consumers’ awareness, (iv) social media truth and level of trust, and (v) social media uses and content creation—was created and shared online. A total of 341 questionnaires were returned of which 339 surveys were valid. This study revealed that less than one-third of the study group (27.1%) knew which of the food safety news were fake. Most respondents (67.8%) were less likely to purchase the affected foods if the foods were featured in social media as problematic, although no differences were made between true and fake news and how that would influence respondents’ willingness to purchase affected foods. Overall, 62% of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed about the usage of social media and its ability to prevent food poisoning cases, while more than 50% of the respondents were in total agreement that social media allow consumers to act more responsibly by sharing food safety news. Respondents tended to trust information shared by scientists (67.5%) and family members and friends (33%). Respondents would most often share the news after verifying its authenticity (46%). If respondents experienced a personal food safety issue (e.g., discovered a fly in their meal), they seldom or never took photos to post online (56.1%). It is possible that the respondents preferred to inform the food handlers and/or shop owners about the affected products rather than post the photos online. It is suggested that targeted food safety information and media literacy be provided to improve consumers’ awareness and to positively influence self-verification of the food safety information before sharing. This study provides crucial insights for a range of stakeholders, particularly public authorities, food bloggers, and the public, in using social media effectively to build consumers’ awareness and trust in food safety information.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an online survey among 1,793 adults in the USA in early April. All participants were randomly enrolled in this research through a professional survey company. The structural equation modeling via Amos 20 was adopted for hypothesis testing. Findings: Results indicated that individuals also perceived that others were more influenced by misinformation about COVID-19 than they were. Further, such a perceptual gap was associated with public support for governmental restrictions and corrective action. Negative affections toward health misinformation directly affected public support for governmental restrictions rather than corrective action. Support for governmental restrictions could further facilitate corrective action. Originality/value: This study examined the applicability of TPE theory in the context of digital health misinformation during a unique global crisis. It explored the significant role of negative affections in influencing restrictive and corrective actions. Practically, this study offered implications for information and communication educators and practitioners.

Many cases were subsequently reported in other cities, which has aroused strong reverberations on the Internet and social media around the world. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the reaction of global Internet users to the outbreak of COVID-19 by evaluating the possibility of using Internet monitoring as an instrument in handling communicable diseases and responding to public health emergencies. Methods: The disease-related data were retrieved from China’s National Health Commission (CNHC) and World Health Organization (WHO) from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Daily Google Trends (GT) and daily Baidu Attention Index (BAI) for the keyword “Coronavirus” were collected from their official websites. Rumors which occurred in the course of this outbreak were mined from Chinese National Platform to Refute Rumors (CNPRR) and Tencent Platform to Refute Rumors (TPRR). Kendall’s Tau-B rank test was applied to check the bivariate correlation among the two indexes mentioned above, epidemic trends, and rumors. Results: After the outbreak of COVID-19, both daily BAI and daily GT increased rapidly and remained at a high level, this process lasted about 10 days. When major events occurred, daily BAI, daily GT, and the number of rumors simultaneously reached new peaks. Our study indicates that these indexes and rumors are statistically related to disease-related indicators. Information symmetry was also found to help significantly eliminate the false news and to prevent rumors from spreading across social media through the epidemic outbreak. Conclusion: Compared to traditional methods, Internet monitoring could be particularly efficient and economical in the prevention and control of epidemic and rumors by reflecting public attention and attitude, especially in the early period of an outbreak. © 2020 Xie et al.","COVID-19; Internet monitoring; Public attention; Search index","Article; China; controlled study; Coronavirinae; coronavirus disease 2019; disinformation; emergency; epidemic; human; Internet; internet access; monitoring; public health; public opinion; social attitude; social media; trend study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090365213

Irresponsible use of social media has resulted in social vices such as violence, terrorism, child pornography and a myriad of other social ills. To counter the social media-induced threats, most nations have resorted to strict regulatory frameworks that criminalise and penalise some of the social media actions that are viewed as threats to national security. This paper, which is largely based on a literature and documentary survey, explores the threats posed by social media in Zimbabwe. The paper also evaluates the regulatory framework for control of the social media threats in Zimbabwe. The paper reveals that social media platforms have been used to instigate violent protests, to issue subversive statements and to spread fake news, causing fear and despondency amongst citizens. Social media platforms have also been used to facilitate other crimes such as human trafficking and distribution of pornographic material. While several existing statutes have been invoked in the face of these threats, the absence of a specific law to deal with social media threats militates against the current legal framework. © 2020 The Author(s).

Vaccine-promoting organisations are working to curb its influence, but face obstacles. We aimed to analyse their social media strategies and the challenges they encounter. Methods: In this qualitative study, we purposively sampled 21 participants responsible for social media from vaccine-promoting organisations. We used Framework Analysis to explore the data. Results: Vaccine-promoting organisations faced obstacles using social media, including fast-paced change, limited resources, and insufficient organisational buy-in. They experienced difficulties reaching audiences, exploiting social media listening, and measuring impact. Consequently, they may miss opportunities to counter misinformation, connect with groups low in vaccine confidence, and determine diverse audience responses. They lack strong evidence linking social media strategies with behaviour change, and have difficulty understanding silent audiences. Conclusions: Vaccine-promoting organisations have an opportunity to embrace the participatory nature of social media. They could share listening insights with like-minded groups, and conduct research exploring associations between social media strategies and community attitude/behaviour change. Social media platforms could assist by renewing vaccine-promoting organisations' organic reach, supporting the development of tailored listening and credibility tools, and strengthening collaborations to promote credible content. © The Author(s) 2020.","communications media; health communication; health promotion; immunisation; public health; Qualitative research; social media; vaccination; vaccines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095115616

Here, so-called ‘fake news’ are of focus. These are considered problematic, particularly in a high-choice media environment as users tend to show selective behaviour. Much research has demonstrated this selective exposure approach, which has roots in the Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (Festinger, 1957). However, research on the processes of coping with dissonance is still considered sparse. In particu-lar, communication scholars have overlooked emotional states and negotiations. This article analyses the affects that are aroused when users are confronted with opinion-challenging disinformation and how they (emotionally) cope by using different strategies for online information. For this, we used the context of climate change that is widely accepted in Germany. The innovative research design included pre-and post-survey research, stimulus exposure (denying ‘fake news’), observa-tions, and retrospective interviews (n = 50). Through this, we find that perceptions and coping strategies vary individually and that overt behaviour, such as searching for counter-arguments, should be seen against the background of individual ideas and motivations, such as believing in an easy rejection of arguments. Confirming neuroscientific findings, partici-pants felt relieved and satisfied once they were able to dissolve their dissonant state and negative arousal. Dissatisfaction and frustration were expressed if this had not been accomplished. © 2020 by the authors.","Cognitive dissonance; Emotions; Fake news; Online disinformation; Science communication; Selective exposure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090630132

However, content-focused measures do not address the primary causes of the infodemic itself, namely the user’s need to post content as a way of making sense of the situation and for gathering reactions of consensus from friends.

The results show that the two cases adopt different emotional repertoires, depending on the historical and cultural leanings but also on the style of leadership they embrace. This style reverberates in the relationship they seek to build with citizens to stimulate compliance with their decisions and in the use of Facebook to promote positive messages and counter the spreading of misinformation. The article also shows how affective governance and style of leadership contribute to the normative definition of good and deviant citizens in critical historical junctures.

They function as intermediaries between sanctioned YouTube industries and the agency of cultural producers. Expertise is developed through research, strategies, and theories to help content creators mitigate platform-specific risks, particularly the risk of algorithmic invisibility. Experts develop entrepreneurial self-brands and position themselves as YouTube’s adversaries, performing “experiments” ostensibly to reveal or translate hidden algorithmic signals or correct “misleading” information. However, ultimately, they teach creators to be complicit with YouTube’s organizational strategies and business models. Studying algorithmic experts reveals insights into how new media producers negotiate platform visibility, but also speaks to long-standing questions about how the management of risk in cultural industries shapes symbolic production. I draw on a 3-year ethnography of YouTube industries to illustrate how experts interpret and instruct in how to become algorithmically (and advertiser) compliant on YouTube. In addition, I highlight their broader role as de facto producers and gatekeepers for aspiring and existing content producers. Meritocratic logic flows through experts’ outputs—meaning expertise is limited to individualized and patchwork solutions that do not address the significant socio-economic inequalities that are still inherent on social media platforms. © The Author(s) 2020.","algorithms; optimization; YouTube",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078363134

However, the validity of the content on spondyloarthritis (SpA) on YouTube is not known. Objectives: To evaluate the content, reliability, and quality of the most viewed English-language YouTube videos on SpA. Methods: Keywords “spondyloarthritis,” “spondyloarthropathy,” and “ankylosing spondylitis” were searched on YouTube on October 7, 2019. The top 270 videos were screened. Videos were excluded if they were irrelevant, in non-English language, or if they had no audio. Total number of views, duration on YouTube (days), video length, upload date, and number of likes, dislikes, subscribers, and comments were recorded for videos. A modified 5-point DISCERN tool and the 5-point Global Quality Scale (GQS) score were used to assess the reliability and quality of the videos. Results: Two hundred videos were included in the final analysis (62% from healthcare professionals, 37% from patients, and 2% from news channels).

A rapid online survey was carried out to evaluate vaccine literacy (VL) skills in the general population and perceptions about COVID-19 vaccine candidates, along with behavior and beliefs about current vaccinations. Observed VL levels were consistent with previous observations–where comparable self-reported tools were administered face-to-face and by paper-and-pencil–the mean functional score being = 2.92, while the interactive-critical score was = 3.27, out of a maximum of 4. Perceptions regarding future COVID-19 vaccines, along with beliefs about vaccination, were mostly positive and significantly associated with functional and interactive-critical VL scales. Despite limitations, the study confirms that surveys via the web are a suitable method to evaluate and track attitudes during infectious disease outbreaks and assess health literacy skills about vaccination, which can be useful to adapt medical communication strategies, for a better understanding of the value of immunization. © 2020 The Author(s).

It chronicles official statements from various library and information associations as they were released in real-time, thereby providing a contemporary and historical snapshot of the early stages of this global health crisis. The aim is to both historically and thematically contextualize these initial responses to help establish a foundation upon which to anchor, build, extend and analyze approaches to the pandemic as it unfolded (and indeed as it continues to unfold at the time of this writing in June 2020). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon a qualitative documentary analysis of statements on COVID-19 released by various international library and information associations, this study provides a thematic analysis of these contemporary policies. Specifically, this thematic analysis was carried out to identify and illuminate major themes appearing within the statements. Further, a comparative thematic analysis was then undertaken to compare the themes across all statements to discover and determine convergences or divergences in content and coverage. Findings: The formal statements released by these organizations feature and share many similar themes in their initial responses to COVID-19, including support for/solidarity with libraries; information provision; maintaining services; digital migration of services; workplace arrangements/concerns; contextual contingencies of libraries (diversity of kinds, circumstances and challenges); health concerns and proper/good hygiene; countering dis/misinformation; external collaborations with public health agencies; and partnerships with industry including publishers. Research limitations/implications: Although this study’s purview is admittedly limited in size and scope – involving six, albeit major, library and information associations from mainly English speaking countries – it can be used as a foundation for further studies into how libraries and information centres in other English and non-English speaking countries responded to the coronavirus pandemic. Practical implications: This study can help inform current, alternative, contingency or other future library responses geared towards or tailored for the coronavirus or other health-related crises. It can also be used as a baseline to track the trajectory of library responses and actions as they unfolded throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Social implications: By providing the start of an account and analysis of the international library and information science (LIS) community’s initial responses, this study also contributes to the broader (ongoing) conversation about the coronavirus pandemic and intervenes in emerging historical examinations of this crisis. This study could be of interest to LIS scholars and practitioners, in addition to public health researchers, public policymakers, cultural studies academics and historians, interested in how different and intersectional efforts – in this case, the international LIS community – contributed and can contribute to this pandemic and other similar or parallel crises. Originality/value: The international library and information community’s initial responses to this global health crisis are contextualized, thereby serving as a foundation upon which to anchor, build and extend other research on responses to the pandemic as it unfolded. Drawing upon a qualitative documentary analysis of these statements, this study presents and discusses the international library community’s initial responses to the coronavirus pandemic. It chronicles these statements as they were released in real-time, thereby providing a contemporary and historical snapshot of the early stages of this crisis. The aim is to both historically and thematically contextualize the international library and information community’s initial responses to help establish a foundation upon which to anchor, build, extend and update the international library community’s responses to the pandemic as it unfolded (and indeed as it continues to unfold at the time of this writing in June 2020). This foundation, it is hoped, will help illuminate their respective positions, circumstances, convergences, divergences and areas of possible (future) cooperation, coordination and collaboration. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Coronavirus; COVID-19; Health; Health services; Libraries; Library materials; Library services; Library users; Pandemic",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089299065

Study design: Qualitative content analysis. Methods: All pages that inform and educate parents regarding childhood vaccination were downloaded and analyzed according to evidence-informed risk communication metrics. Results: A total of 32 webpages, 14 videos, and two infographics were included in the analysis. The following were the most frequent risk communication approaches: ‘debunking common misconceptions about vaccination’ or ‘answering common questions about vaccines.’ Harm and benefit information focused primarily on the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases and the risks of adverse events after immunization. Most materials used qualitative terminology to describe the risk (e.g., vaccines are among the safest tools, adverse events are rare). Very few materials provided numeric likelihood of harms and benefits. When numeric information was stated, they were only presenting the risks of the diseases or number of cases in an outbreak. The approaches used to debunk misconceptions generally focused on the myth itself rather than the correct information. Few materials used visual aids (e.g., graphics, pictures, icons arrays, etc.) to convey important information. Conclusions: It is often assumed that misinformation and rumors about vaccination found online is a leading cause of the increase in vaccine hesitancy. Existing communication materials could be improved to better align with best practices in risk communication. Given the availability of confusing and conflicting vaccine narratives, it is crucial that authoritative communication materials aim to build trust and support informed choices about vaccination. © 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health","France; Official discourse; Qualitative analysis; Québec; Vaccination; Vaccine hesitancy; Websites","influenza vaccine; measles mumps rubella vaccine; decision making; qualitative analysis; vaccination; vaccine; World Wide Web; analysis of variance; Article; clinical decision making; clinical practice; content analysis; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug safety; health care cost; herd immunity; human; immunization; influenza; measles; medical information; mumps; nomenclature; qualitative analysis; rubella; therapeutic misconception; vaccination; Canada; France; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074015716

This study aimed to identify factors that conjointly influenced NVP relative harm perception among smokers and ex-smokers. Methods: Data (n = 11,838) from adult smokers and ex-smokers (quit < 2 years) who participated in the 2016 ITC 4 Country Smoking and Vaping Surveys in Australia, Canada, England and the US were analyzed. Decision tree models were used to classify respondents into those who perceived vaping as less harmful than smoking (“correct” perception) versus otherwise (“incorrect” perception) based on their socio-demographic, smoking and vaping related variables. Results: Decision tree analysis identified nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) harmfulness perceptions relative to smoking, perceived vaping portrayal in the media and other sources as positive, negative or balanced, recency of seeking online vaping information, and age as the key variables that interacted conjointly to classify respondents into those with “correct” versus “incorrect” harm perceptions of vaping relative to smoking (model performance accuracy = 0.70–0.74). In all countries, NRT relative harmfulness perception and vaping portrayal perception were consistently the two most important classifying variables, with other variables showing some country differences. Conclusions: In all four countries, perception of NVP relative harmfulness among smokers and recent ex-smokers is strongly influenced by a combination of NRT relative harmfulness perception and vaping portrayal in the media and other sources. These conjoint factors can serve as useful markers for identifying subgroups more vulnerable to misperception about NVP relative harmfulness to benefit from corrective intervention. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Decision tree analysis; Ex-smokers; Nicotine vaping products; Risk perception; Smokers",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096384196

There are also people who edit or even tamper images to deliberately deliver false information under different purposes. Thus, in digital forensics, it is necessary to understand the manipulating history of images. That requires to verify all possible manipulations applied to images. Among all the image editing manipulations, recoloring is widely used to adjust or repaint the colors in images. The color information is an important visual information that image can deliver. Thus, it is necessary to guarantee the correctness of color in digital forensics. On the other hand, many image retouching or editing applications or software are equipped with recoloring function. This enables ordinary people without expertise of image processing to apply recoloring for images. Hence, in order to secure the color information of images, in this paper, a recoloring detection method is proposed. The method is based on convolutional neural network which is quite popular in recent years. Unlike the traditional linear classifier, the proposed method can be employed for binary classification as well as multiple labels classification. The classification performance of different structure for the proposed architecture is also investigated in this paper. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

And, there are a large number of malicious nodes in the network. These malicious nodes may tamper with the correct data and pass them to other nodes. The normal nodes will use the wrong data for information dissemination due to a lack of ability to verify the correctness of the messages received, resulting in the dissemination of false information on medical, social, and other networks. Auditing user attributes and behavior information to identify malicious user nodes is an important way to secure networks. In response to the user nodes audit problem, a user audit model based on attribute measurement and similarity measurement (AM-SM-UAM) is proposed. Firstly, the user attribute measurement algorithm is constructed, using a hierarchical decision model to construct a judgment matrix to analyze user attribute data. Secondly, the blog similarity measurement algorithm is constructed, evaluating the similarity of blog posts published by different users based on the improved Levenshtein distance. Finally, a user audit model based on a security degree is built, and malicious users are defined by security thresholds.

The temperature sensor generates a duty-cycle-modulated signal by applying a proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) current and a complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) current derived from substrate bipolar junction transistors (BJT) to an integrator followed by a window comparator. The duty-cycle-modulated signal is then converted to a digital representation of temperature with two counters. Calibration is performed in the digital domain with three calibration parameters. Dynamic element matching (DEM) and chopping techniques are also used to minimize the errors caused by the component mismatch. The prototype chip is fabricated in a 0.5μm CMOS process. The chip area occupies 2.3mm2. Measurement results from 11 test chips show that an inaccuracy of -1.1-0.5∘C is achieved over the temperature range from - 35 to 85∘C after calibration. The 2.5 V supply voltage is utilized and the total power consumption is 0.83 mW at a conversion rate of 0.5 kSa/s with a resolution of 0.0625∘C/LSB, leading to 6.48 - nJ ∘C 2 resolution figure of merit (FoM) and 2951.1 - nJ % 2 accuracy FoM. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Calibration parameter; Chopping technique; CMOS temperature sensor; Digital temperature representation; Duty-cycle modulation; Dynamic element matching (DEM)","Bipolar transistors; CMOS integrated circuits; Modulation; Surveying; Temperature sensors; Calibration parameters; Chopping technique; Digital temperature; Duty-cycle modulations; Dynamic element matching; Calibration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065296742

Once inserted, it can be difficult to correct the orientation of the implant axis, especially of a one-piece implant. Prosthetic-driven digital implant planning in combination with fully guided implant surgery can offer additional safety in such cases. Case presentation: The patient presented with a wide, edentulous interdental space extending from sites 13 to 16, which was to be restored with three one-piece zirconia implants supporting a zirconia fixed partial denture comprizing a cantilever to the mesial aspect. Digital planning based on DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) and intraoral surface data was performed to ensure optimal positioning. Guided implant placement was executed using a contra-angle handpiece with special attachments and a compatible, sleeveless drill guide. Impressions of the implants for the final restoration were acquired using an intraoral scanner. Reflection-related errors were compensated for by using the given digital abutment geometry. The DICOM and STL datasets were superimposed and used as the basis for fabricating a monolithic zirconia restoration through a subtractive milling process. The final restoration was adhesively cemented. Conclusions: By using a prosthetic-driven implant planning strategy, it was possible to place the one-piece ceramic implants without an available implant manufacturer's guidebased solution. This was accomplished using a contra-angle surgical handpiece with special attachments and a compatible drill guide. This approach is particularly recommended for the placement of one-piece implants, which otherwise require irreversible abutment grinding for the adjustment of the implant axis orientation after placement.

In addition to detecting layer internal defects, layer imaging offers the possibility to retrieve the outer contours of a layer and thus three-dimensionally reconstruct the side walls of a part by vertically stacking contours belonging to sequential layers. The current open challenges for layer imaging relate to the compromise between imaging resolution and extension of covered area, and to the complexity of image interpretation, exacerbated by optically difficult materials, complex filament patterns and non-uniform environmental conditions. In this work we propose an original optical imaging solution for layer contour identification and stacking. Our solution overcomes the current challenges related to range/resolution and image interpretation by making use of digital twins, i.e. geometric simulations of the layer, based on the current manufacturing process parameters. Thanks to the use of digital twins, our vision system is able to: use high-resolution imaging only where it is needed, by following the predicted positions of the layer contours while acquiring a sequence of images; algorithmically interpret each image by concentrating only on interesting regions as suggested by the simulated prediction, thus reducing the risk for false positives; and finally monitor contour quality by performing a more accurate comparison between the measurement and a reference contour obtained by a simulation which replicates the actual fingerprint of the process, as opposed to simply relying on the edge obtained by slicing the CAD model. The in-process monitoring capability of the computer vision system is demonstrated through the fabrication of acceptable and defected instances of a test geometry. Fabrication issues are effectively and efficiently detected by the system and alarms are triggered that can be used to command early termination of the build process or to initiate corrective actions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Computer Vision; Fused Filament Fabrication; Material extrusion; Process monitoring and control","Computer aided design; Computer aided software engineering; Defects; Digital twin; Fabrication; Geometry; Image analysis; Imaging techniques; Optical image storage; Process control; Process monitoring; Risk assessment; Computer vision system; Environmental conditions; Geometric simulation; High-resolution imaging; Image interpretation; In-process monitoring; Manufacturing process parameters; Optical imaging solution; Computer vision",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092013764

Various tools that use a BIM model for automatic quantity take-off as basis for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) have been developed recently. This paper describes the first application of such a BIM-LCA tool to evaluate the embodied global warming potential (GWP) throughout the whole design process of a real building. 34 states of the BIM model are analysed weekly. The results show that the embodied GWP during the design phase is twice as high as for the final building. These changes can be mainly attributed to the designers' approach of using placeholder materials that are refined later, besides other reasons. As such, the embodied GWP is highly overestimated and a BIM-based environmental assessment during the design process could be misleading and counterproductive. Finally, three alternatives to the established automatic quantity take-off are discussed for future developments. © 2019","Building Information Modelling (BIM); Design process; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Performance assessment","Digital devices; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Global warming; Information theory; Life cycle; Structural design; Building Information Modelling; Design process; Environmental assessment; Environmental performance assessment; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Performance assessment; Quantity take offs; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073918957

We demonstrate how voltage values used for writing in the TAS-MRAM cells can make stochastic behaviors required for PUF design. The analysis of the obtained results provides some preliminary findings on the practical application of TAS-MRAM-based PUFs in authentication protocols. Besides, the results show that for key-generation protocols, one of the standard error correction methods should be employed if the proposed PUF is used. © 2020 Roman Science Publications and Distributions.

The current digital compensation method can reduce the CA by pre-processing the image contents but at the cost of extra memory space, processing time, and power consumption. Moreover, it is not possible to digitally compensate the CA within each color channel. Here, a practical optical approach is presented to correct the CAs, including the sub-channel ones, in the virtual reality system, whose functionality is verified by both ray-tracing analysis and experimental results. In this device, a compact ultra-broadband Pancharatnam-Berry phase lens (PBL) with complex axial molecular structure is fabricated and then hybridized with a refractive Fresnel lens. Due to their opposite chromatic dispersion, the system's CA is significantly reduced. To eliminate ghost image from the zero-order leakage of PBL, a broadband circular polarizer is implemented to block the stray light. As a result, clear image within the entire 100° field-of-view is achieved. The proposed large-size cost-efficient broadband wide-view flat optics can practically benefit not only virtual reality displays but also general imaging systems for practical applications and scientific research. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Such videos can pose a great threat to the society in various social and political ways and can be used for malicious purposes. These fake videos are called deepfakes. Deepfakes refer to manipulated videos, or other digital representations produced by sophisticated artificial intelligence, that yield fabricated images and sounds that appear to be real. A deep-learning system can produce a persuasive counterfeit by studying photographs and videos of a target person from multiple angles, and then mimicking its behaviour and speech patterns. Detecting these videos is a massive problem because of the increasing developments in more realistic deepfake creation technologies emerging every now and then. The paper aims to solve this problem by proposing a model that analyses the frames of the videos using deep learning approach to detect inconsistencies in facial features, compression rate and discrepancies introduced in the videos while creating them. The model uses a convolutional neural network along with transfer learning to train the model that can catch these instilled errors in the deepfakes. The neural network is trained on these discrepancies induced during deepfake creation around the face. It uses a dataset called “Celeb-DF: A New Dataset for DeepFake Forensics” to train the model.

In terms of material morphology, some basic issues will be addressed when a twodimensional layered crystal is shaped into a one-dimensional (1D) geometry due to size effect; these include the spaceconfined transport in a plane, which leads to dramatic changes in electronic, optical, and thermal properties. These novel 1D nanostructures with unique properties are an optimal choice for fabricating next-generation integrated circuits and functional devices within the nanometer scale such as gate-all-around field-effect transistors, single-electron transistors, chemical sensors, and THz detectors. As one of the high-mobility 2D semiconductor, 1D high-quality Bi2O2Se nanoribbons could be promising for applications in high-performance transistors; however, their synthesis has not been completely developed yet. In our study, we report on the facile growth of Bi2O2Se nanoribbons on mica substrates via a bismuthcatalyzed vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. The preparation of Bi2O2Se nanoribbons is based on a previous work that emphasized on the oxidation of Bi2Se3 in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system and the use of bismuth (Bi) particles as the precursor of Bi catalysis. The morphology, composition, and structure of the as-grown Bi2O2Se nanoribbons were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as other methods. For a Bi mediated VLS growth process, the growth of Bi2O2Se nanoribbons can be self-assembled; further, in this process, as-grown epitaxial Bi2O2Se nanoribbons are free-standing with out-of-plane morphology on the mica substrate. Additionally, combining the spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscope (ACTEM) and selected electron diffraction (SAED) methods, we discovered that the assynthesized Bi2O2Se nanoribbons were single crystalline with high quality. We further investigated the controllable growth for domain size by optimizing the growth temperature of the Bi2O2Se nanoribbons. As-synthesized single-crystal Bi2O2Se nanoribbons have widths in the range of 100 nm to 20 μm and lengths in the sub-millimeter range. By employing a polymer poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) assisted clean transfer method with the assistance of deionized water, the Bi2O2Se nanoribbons can be easily transferred onto a SiO2/Si substrate. Fabricated into the top-gated field-effect device, the Bi2O2Se nanoribbon sample (transferred to the SiO2/Si substrate) exhibited high electronic performances; these included a high electron mobility of ∼220 cm2·V−1·s−1 at room temperature, good switching behavior with on/off ratio of &gt;106, and high on current density of ∼42 μA·μm−1 at a channel length of 10 μm. Therefore, Bi2O2Se nanoribbons are expected to be a promising materials for building high-performance transistors in the future. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.","Bismuth oxyselenide; CVD; High mobility; Nanoribbons; Vapor-liquid-solid growth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077007639

While previous research on online disinformation has focused on the individual level, the current study aims to shed light on cross-national differences. It compares online disinformation re-published by fact checkers from four Western democracies (the US, the UK, Germany, and Austria). The findings reveal significant differences between English-speaking and German-speaking countries. In the US and the UK, the largest shares of partisan disinformation are found, while in Germany and Austria sensationalist stories prevail. Moreover, in English-speaking countries, disinformation frequently attacks political actors, whereas in German-speaking countries, immigrants are most frequently targeted. Across all of the countries, topics of false stories strongly mirror national news agendas. Based on these results, the paper argues that online disinformation is not only a technology-driven phenomenon but also shaped by national information environments. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","content analysis; Disinformation; international comparison; partisanship; polarization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047204649

However, SI initiatives have been criticized for neglecting social welfare outcomes. A recent review found that better-off farmers benefitted disproportionately from SI and highlighted the dearth of studies assessing the equity of outcomes. In this study, we explore the social inclusiveness of zero-tillage (ZT) wheat adoption in Bihar, India. ZT is a proven SI technology for enhancing wheat productivity while boosting profitability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural machinery in the densely populated Indo-Gangetic Plains. With an average landholding size of 0.39 ha, most farmers in Bihar depend on custom-hiring services to access the technology. While service provision models should foster inclusive growth by reducing financial barriers to technology adoption, early evidence suggested that smallholders remained at a disadvantage. Building on this previous research, we use a panel dataset from 961 wheat-growing households that spans a six-year period to analyze ZT adoption dynamics over time while accounting for the role of social networks and access to service provision. Using a heckprobit approach to correct for non-exposure bias, we compare determinants of ZT awareness and use in 2012 and 2015. We apply a multinomial logit model to identify determinants of early adoption, recent adoption, non-adoption, and dis-adoption. Furthermore, we explore the quality of ZT services as an additional dimension of socially-inclusive technology access. We find that the strong initial scale bias in ZT use declined substantially as awareness of the technology increased and the service economy expanded. Land fragmentation replaced total landholding size as a significant adoption determinant, which also affected the quality of ZT services received. Hence, farmers with small but contiguous landholdings appear to have gained a significant degree of access over time. We conclude that early-stage assessments of SI may be misleading, and that private sector-based service provision can contribute to socially inclusive development outcomes as markets mature. © 2019 The Author(s)","Bihar; Service economy; Social inclusiveness; Social network effects; South Asia; Zero-tillage adoption","agricultural intensification; smallholder; social inclusion; social network; technology adoption; wheat; zero tillage; Bihar; Gangetic Plain; India; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068378754

The government has appealed to China to fund large-scale projects in the transport sector, and as a consequence of this, construction firms from China have emerged as significant employers in the country. While the Kenyan government contends with the ongoing burden of youth unemployment, it must also reconcile the ambiguities of China's role in Africa and its implications for the labour market. This article examines two Chinese-built infrastructure projects in Kenya and their intersection with several issues involving migrant labour and local rumours of Chinese prisoners, as well as the state's vision for industrialization and youth employment. Kenyans utilize both online and interpersonal channels of discourse to critique present-day employment practices in the transport sector, and it is argued that these counter-channels of discourse represent a particular articulation of knowledge used by Kenyans to construct meaning and interpret ambiguous situations. Through a theoretical analysis of rumour, this article illustrates how ordinary Kenyans are pooling their intellectual resources to understand Sino-Kenyan labour relations in the absence of transparency and participatory government processes in the infrastructure sector. © International African Institute 2019.",,"construction industry; economic growth; industrialization; infrastructural development; investment; labor market; labor relations; migrant worker; state role; unemployment; young population; China; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079419119

Natural polymers, such as collagen and fibrin hydrogels, have experienced especially broad adoption due to the high density of cell adhesion sites compared to their synthetic counterparts, ready availability, and ease of use. However, these and other hydrogels lack the structural and mechanical anisotropy that define the ECM in many tissues, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, tendon, and cartilage. Herein, we present a facile, low-cost, and automated method of preparing collagen microfibers, organizing these fibers into precisely controlled mesh designs, and embedding these meshes in a bulk hydrogel, creating a composite biomaterial suitable for a wide variety of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. With the assistance of custom software tools described herein, mesh patterns are designed by a digital graphical user interface and translated into protocols that are executed by a custom mesh collection and organization device. We demonstrate a high degree of precision and reproducibility in both fiber and mesh fabrication, evaluate single fiber mechanical properties, and provide evidence of collagen self-assembly in the microfibers under standard cell culture conditions. This work offers a powerful, flexible platform for the study of tissue engineering and cell material interactions, as well as the development of therapeutic biomaterials in the form of custom collagen microfiber patterns that will be accessible to all through the methods and techniques described here. Collagen microfiber meshes have immediate and broad applications in tissue engineering research and show high potential for later use in clinical therapeutics due to their compositional similarities to native extracellular matrix and tunable structural and mechanical characteristics. Physical and biological characterizations of these meshes demonstrate physiologically relevant mechanical properties, native-like collagen structure, and cytocompatibility. The methods presented herein not only describe a process through which custom collagen microfiber meshes can be fabricated but also provide the reader with detailed device plans and software tools to produce their own bespoke meshes through a precise, consistent, and automated process. © 2019 Nicholas J.

Although social media offers organisations promoting vaccination unparalleled opportunities to promote evidence and counterbalance misinformation, we know relatively little about their internal workings. The aim of this paper is to explore the strategies, perspectives and experiences of communicators working within such organisations as they promote vaccination and respond to misinformation on social media. Methods: Using qualitative methods, we purposively sampled 21 participants responsible for routine social media activity and strategy from Australian organisations actively promoting vaccination on social media, including government health departments, local health services, advocacy groups, professional associations and technical/scientific organisations. We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews to explore their perspectives and practices. Applying Risk Communication principles as a lens, we used Framework Analysis to explore the data both inductively and deductively. Results: Organisations promoting vaccination face multiple challenges on social media, including misinformation, anti-science sentiment, a complex vaccination narrative and anti-vaccine activists. They developed a range of sophisticated strategies in response, including communicating with openness in an evidence-informed way; creating safe spaces to encourage audience dialogue; fostering community partnerships; and countering misinformation with care. Conclusions: We recommend that communicators consider directly countering misinformation because of the potential influence on their silent audience, i.e. those observing but not openly commenting, liking or sharing posts. Refutations should be straightforward, succinct and avoid emphasizing misinformation. Communicators should consider pairing scientific evidence with stories that speak to audience beliefs and values. Finally, organisations could enhance vaccine promotion and their own credibility on social media by forming strong links with organisations sharing similar values and goals. © 2019 The Author(s).","Anti-vaccination movement; Health communication; Health promotion; Immunisation; Misinformation; Public health; Qualitative methods; Social media; Vaccination","Australia; human; interpersonal communication; organization; organization and management; qualitative research; social media; vaccination; Australia; Communication; Humans; Organizations; Qualitative Research; Social Media; Vaccination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073757091

Scientific debates over global catastrophic flooding and the Earth’s geologic age were resolved by the mid-nineteenth century, but subsequent nonscientific debates about the Earth’s age and biological evolution spawned a distrust of science that hardened in the twentieth century. Disregard for science grew in the United States with abandonment of science-based policy by government and manipulation of public opinion by social media. Consequently, climate change denial was readily accepted by a preconditioned antiscience culture. Expansion of antiscience sentiment led to rejection of conventional news outlets and information verification in a “post-truth” era in which alternate realities are acceptable despite clear contradictions with observable facts. Critical reasoning and vetting of information are in decline, which leaves democracy vulnerable to manipulation. Reliable information is available but obscured by disinformation. Public scrutiny of information and demand for fact checking and reporting of sources are essential given growth of alternative media that have no checks on the verity of content. Academics should get involved in popular media to counter propaganda and to reconstruct a culture of critical reasoning by voters and science-based decisions by policymakers.

With approximately six million (11%) of the UK population now listening to podcasts in an average week, the podcast renaissance raises new questions about the relationship between cultural production, consumption and representation. This paper explores the significance of the new wave of podcasts, specifically with regards to racial politics in the UK and its potential power as an anti-racist tool. Through a series of interview and focus group discussions with black and Asian podcasters in the UK, it asks what role podcasts play in providing an alternative space for ‘communities of resistance’. These issues are examined against the dual contexts in the UK of an intensifyingly hostile environment for black and minority ethnic groups and a digital and creative sector marked by social and cultural inequalities. The article suggests that in a ‘post fact’ international climate of disinformation that bolsters populist rhetoric around minority cultural groups, podcasts have become a rare space for articulating the lived experiences of these groups, whilst also challenging broader patterns of racialized disenfranchisement, including in the creative industries. Podcasts facilitate new forms of social affiliation and anti-racism; which we analyse through Fraser’s concept of “subaltern counterpublics” to unveil the interruptive potentiality of the medium for marginalised communities seeking to make accessible alternative representations and perspectives on the relationship between race and society. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Therefore, exploring the laws of rumor propagation has been one of the hot topics in current researches. Most traditional rumor spreading models are based on infectious disease transmission models, such as SIR. Since the influence of individual differences and the network structure on rumor spreading are not considered, the rumor propagation process in complex networks can only be described in a coarse-grained manner. In this paper, we consider the role of different users in rumor propagation. Based on the degree of different nodes in the network, we design a new state transition function for each node and proposed a new rumor propagation ILSR model. Firstly, we analyze the model, calculate the equilibrium point and the basic reproductive number to prove the rationality of the model. Then experiments are performed in WS networks, BA scale-free networks and a real Facebook network to investigate the relationship between various nodes with time and the impact of network structure on rumor propagation, and the experimental results show the correctness and effectiveness of the model.

Failure to correct these may hinder efforts to conserve energy and undermine support for evidence-based policies. Here we present a randomized online experiment that showed that home energy perceptions can be improved. We tested two simple, potentially scalable interventions: providing numerical information (in watt-hours) about extremes of energy use and providing an explicit heuristic that addressed a common misperception. Both succeeded in improving numerical estimates of energy use, but in different ways. Numerical information about extremes primarily improved the use of the watt-hours response scale, while the heuristic improved underlying understanding of relative energy use. As a result, only the heuristic significantly benefitted judgements about energy-conserving behaviours. Because understanding of energy use also predicted self-reported energy-conservation behaviour, belief in climate change, and support for climate policies, targeting energy misperceptions may have the potential to shape individual behaviour and national policy support. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Climate change; Energy utilization; Conserve energy; Energy-conserving; Evidence-based; Individual behaviour; National policies; Numerical information; On-line experiments; Relative energies; Energy conservation; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy planning; heuristics; numerical method; residential energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073538544

To extend the dynamic range considerably, the already successfully demonstrated concept of a linear self-reset pixel was employed in this work. With the self-reset concept the limit of the maximum analyzable photo generated charge (Qmax) during the exposure time is extended to a multiple of the saturation charge of the photo diode (Qsat) by asynchronous self-resets of the photo diode. Additionally, the remaining charge at the end of the exposure time is evaluated to increase the resolution of the opto-electronic conversion. Thus we achieved pixels with a DR of more than 120 dB combined with an improved low light sensitivity using a pinned photodiode. This paper focuses on two topics: One is the realization and opto-electronic characterization of further self-reset pixel cells for an experimental optimization of the functionality with respect to linearity and high signal-to-noise ratio. The second one is the assembly and digital readout of a cluster structure composed of 16 × 16 pixel matrix on a CMOS test chip. One constraint for later usage of the pixel cells in a high resolution (>VGA) image sensor is the required layout area of the individual circuit blocks. For the cluster structure a size of 20 × 20 μm for the analog part of the pixel containing the photo diode and the other analog circuit blocks, the comparator and the signal shaping, was desired. The circuit design and layout work included several variants of the pinned photo diode with floating diffusion (FD) readout node, which is also used for analog voltage storage, and different control transistors. Further for the comparator a telescopic differential amplifier with high gain was implemented as well as peripheral 10 bit counter/shift register as static and dynamic versions. Test chips have been fabricated in an advanced 0.18 μm CMOS technology for optical sensors with low leakage currents. The sensor chips have been evaluated with a specifically developed test setup which gives the flexibility to arbitrarily generate the digital and analog control signals in terms of timing and voltage levels. Based on this, the number of asynchronous self-resets could be read out from the counters of the pixel cells as coarse values. The remaining charge at the end of the integration time was digitized using a ramp analog to digital conversion and could be read out as fine values. An opto-electronic characterization with adjustable illumination from 0 lx to 13 klx was done to measure and analyze the opto-electronic conversion function (OECF) and the noise of six different self-reset pixel cells having the high-gain differential amplifier as comparator. Finally the coarse values of two implemented 16 × 16 pixel clusters could be read out as a mini camera using a lens for optical image formation. © Author(s) 2019.",,"Analog to digital conversion; CMOS integrated circuits; Comparator circuits; Comparators (optical); Differential amplifiers; Digital cameras; Digital to analog conversion; Diodes; Electric network analysis; Geometrical optics; Image sensors; Integrated circuit layout; Integrated circuit manufacture; Leakage currents; Lenses; Signal to noise ratio; Cluster structure; CMOS image sensor; Conversion function; Experimental optimization; High signal-to-noise ratio; Limited dynamic ranges; Low-leakage current; Pinned photodiodes; Pixels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072555063

However, there is a growing misperception that congeries of data can be easily reconstructed into competitive business insights. Such notions have been encouraged by a plethora of mainstream techno-utopian forecasts. Design/methodology/approach: This paper investigated such claims and related big data developments, including its “systems-first” and oligopolistic orientations. Due to the paucity of current scholarship on an admittedly pessimistic topic, the paper studied contrarian developments in the industry by relying on secondary data. The study of experts and scholars; industrial trends; and discrepancies and critical gaps in the mainstream data narrative were sourced to prognosticate the likely trajectory of many data giants. Findings: A key finding was that the big data industry faces an untenable market bubble worth trillions of dollars. This will have severe consequences for common digital access and social stability worldwide. Evidence presented also suggests that the data industrial complex may undergo a function creep by facilitating a transition from surveillance capitalism to surveillance society. Research limitations/implications: Primary data for a study of this nature may take years to materialize. This is a “first-pass” study that seeks to illuminate latent dangers facing the big data/AI sector. There is a paucity of scholarly study that even remotely touches on this topic. Therefore, supporting arguments was sourced from contemporary reports and expert study (secondary data). Practical implications: As control of data may have geostrategic implications, balkanization of the wired ecosystem may be underway with Russia and China leading the way. Future superpowers may be defined by the way they handle data. The concentration of data in fewer hands may also affect citizen innovation. Social implications: A break-down of the data industrial complex may lead to social mayhem as the monetization of presently free software, blogs and social media platforms may be unfeasible. Originality/value: This topic has hardly been explored due to the novelty of big data, its applications and the daily hype over its potentials.

Here, we present a study of the most tweeted about movie ever (Black Panther) in which the spread of false information of four different types is compared to the ad hoc Twitter community response. We find that (1) false information tweets played a small part in the overall conversation, (2) community-based debunking and shaming responses to false posts about attacks at theaters overwhelmed such posts by orders of magnitude, (3) as another form of community response, one type of false narrative (Satire) was used to attack another (Fake Attacks), and (4) the four types of false-information tweets differed in the use of hashtags and in the role played by originating users and responding users.

With these new technologies comes an essential need for testing methods to assess the resultant image quality. Although randomized clinical trials are the gold standard for assessing image quality, phantom-based studies can provide a simpler and less burdensome approach. In this work, a complete framework is presented for task-based evaluation of microcalcification (MCs) detection performance for DBT imaging systems. Methods: The framework consists of three parts. The first part is a realistic anthropomorphic physical breast phantom created through inkjet printing, with parchment paper and iodine-doped ink. The second is a method for inserting realistic MCs fabricated from calcium hydroxyapatite. The reproducibility and stability of the phantom materials were investigated through multiple samples of parchment and ink over 6 months. The final part is an analysis using a four-alternative forced choice (4AFC) reader study. To demonstrate the framework, a task-based 4AFC study was conducted using a clinical system to compare performance from DBT, synthetic mammography (SM), and full-field digital mammography (FFDM). Nine human observers read images containing MC clusters imaged with all three modalities and tried to correctly locate the MCs. The proportion correct (PC) was measured as the number of correctly detected clusters out of all trials. Results: Overall, readers scored the highest with FFDM, (PC = 0.95 ± 0.03) then DBT (0.85 ± 0.04), and finally SM (0.44 ± 0.06). For the parchment and ink samples, the linear attenuation properties were very stable over 6 months. In addition, little difference was found between the various parchment and ink samples, indicating good reproducibility. Conclusions: This framework presents a promising methodology for evaluating diagnostic task performance of clinical breast DBT systems. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine","anthropomorphic phantom; calcium hydroxyapatite; digital breast tomosynthesis; parchment paper","Calcification (biochemistry); Hydroxyapatite; Image quality; Imaging systems; Ink; Medical imaging; Phantoms; Testing; Tomography; Alternative forced choice; Anthropomorphic phantoms; Calcium hydroxyapatite; Digital breast tomosynthesis; Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT); Full field digital mammography; Microcalcification detection; Randomized clinical trials; Mammography; hydroxyapatite; ink; Article; breast cancer; breast density; breast tissue; controlled study; digital breast tomosynthesis; digital mammography; feedback system; female; filtered back projection; forced choice method; four alternative forced choice; human; image analysis; image quality; luminance; microcalcification; randomized controlled trial; surface property; three dimensional imaging; breast; calcinosis; devices; diagnostic imaging; image processing; imaging phantom; mammography; printing; Breast; Calcinosis; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Ink; Mammography; Phantoms, Imaging; Printing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068511290

By using a single-stage cascode amplifier for each PUF cell, the output impedance can be significantly elevated. Compared with a traditional single-stage amplifier-based current-mode PUF, the proposed structure is capable of generating more polarized voltage value for the output node. With an additional digital buffer, the temporal noise can be well-suppressed, and a rail-to-rail digital output can be provided with high native reliability. Moreover, through operating the transistors at the subthreshold region, the overall power consumption can be dramatically reduced. Featuring a compact footprint of 3.23μm2 (i.e. 764 F2) for each PUF cell, the proposed PUF implementation is validated using 65-nm standard CMOS process. The excellent randomness of the proposed PUF design is verified based on the test results with widely-accepted auto-correlation function and NIST suites. Meanwhile, the PUF's uniqueness is measured with 10 chip prototypes and reported to be 49.94%. In addition, the fabricated PUF chips were also characterized with various environmental influences. With multiple readout (500 times) under the reference operating temperature of 27 °C and supply voltage of 1.2 V, the native unstable bit ratio is measured to be as low as 1.50%, which can be further improved to 0.79% by adopting the mainstream temporal majority voting (TMV)-based error correction scheme. Besides, we also evaluate the fabricated PUF chips' reliability under varied operating temperature from -40 °C to 120 °C and supply voltage from 0.95 to 1.3 V. The averaged bit error rate (BER) per 10 °C and BER per 0.1 V are measured to be 0.86% and 1.02%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art implementations, the reliability figure of merit (RFoM) is improved by 1.16∼ 4.29×, with the influences of the temporal noise, the temperature/supply voltage variations and their ranges comprehensively considered. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","cascode current mirror; high reliability; low power consumption; Physical unclonable function","Analog circuits; Bit error rate; Cryptography; Electric power utilization; Error correction; Hardware security; Mirrors; Reliability; Temperature; Autocorrelation functions; Cascode current mirrors; Environmental influences; Error-correction schemes; High reliability; Low-power consumption; Physical unclonable functions (PUF); Single stage amplifiers; Cascode amplifiers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071952500

The NLP framework includes sentiment analysis, entity analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based phrase association mining. The sentiment analysis demonstrates the sentiment fluctuation over the past 10 years. The results show that there are more negative tweets in 2008 to 2011 and 2015 to 2016. The entity extraction and analysis help to identify the organization, geographical location and events entities associated with the negative and positive tweets. The results show that the organization entities such as FDA, CDC and Merck occur in both negative and positive tweets of almost every year, whereas the geographical location entities mentioned in both negative and positive tweets change from year to year. The reason is because of the specific events that happened in those different locations. The objective of the AI-based phrase association mining is to identify the main topics reflected in both negative and positive tweets and detailed tweet content. Through the phrase association mining, we found that the main negative topics on Twitter include “injuries”, “deaths”, “scandal”, “safety concerns”, and “adverse/side effects”, whereas the main positive topics include “cervical cancers”, “cervical screens”, “prevents”, and “vaccination campaigns”.

The purpose of this study was to assess experimentally the potential effectiveness of the agreement in addressing NAS misperceptions. Methods In an online experiment, 820 current and former smokers were assigned randomly to advertising conditions with existing claims from NAS advertisements, modified claims or a no-exposure control. Advertising conditions included (1) 'original' NAS advertising text before the agreement; (2) '2017 agreement' language permissible under the FDA-SFNTC agreement (removing 'natural', 'additive-free'); (3) more restrictive ('stricter') language representing additional regulation (removing 'natural' from the brand name and the phrases 'tobacco+water', 'no chemicals'). Participants completed outcome measures assessing misinformed beliefs and intentions towards NAS. Results One-way ANOVA showed that relative to the 'original' language, the '2017 agreement' language reduced misconceptions about NAS addictiveness, but not about health or constituent composition. Yet 'stricter' language significantly reduced all categories of misinformed beliefs, which in turn mediated effects on (lower) intentions to use NAS. Conclusion The 2017 agreement helps dispel some misconceptions about NAS addictiveness, but does not sufficiently rectify misinformation about health or composition. Since 'stricter' language more effectively corrects misinformed beliefs, our results suggest the need for further regulations in addressing misinformation that drives intentions towards NAS. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In this article, I argue that organised consumer boycotts should be regarded as a legitimate and purposeful instrument for structural change, provided they conform to a number of normative criteria. In order to show this, the practice and empirical context of consumer boycotts are first outlined. I then lay out and refute three general objections to this practice. Although each of these objections fails, their discussion generates insights concerning the normative standards with which boycotters must comply if they want their campaigns to be both legitimate and successful.

This focus is correlated with in vitro 3D tumor models ability to mimic the multicellular compact structure and spatial architecture of human solid tumors. However, these microphysiological systems generally lack the pre-existence of tumor-ECM, a critical aspect that can affect the overall therapeutic performance and the decision of advancing candidate drugs to later stages of the pipeline. Aiming to face this drawback and mimic tumors-ECM, herein we rapidly fabricated in-air hyaluronan-methacrylate (HA-MA) and gelatin-methacrylate (GelMA) photocrosslinkable 3D spheroid microgels by using superhydrophobic surfaces. These platforms were used for establishing heterotypic 3D co-culture models of prostate cancer cells (PC-3) and human osteoblasts (hOB) to mimic prostate cancer-to-bone metastasis cellular heterogeneity and the tumor-ECM microenvironment. 3D microgel microtumors morphology, size and cell number were easily controlled via digital droplet generation on polystyrene superhydrophobic surfaces and under solvent-free conditions when compared to microfluidics or electrospray. Co-culture 3D microgels formed by 2.5%HA-MA-5%GelMA and 5%HA-MA-5%GelMA ratios showed the highest calcium deposition after 14 days of culture, evidencing osteoblasts viability and the establishment of functional mineralization in the 3D hydrogel matrix. Cisplatin cytotoxicity evaluation showed that 3D microgels are more resistant to platin chemotherapeutics than single or co-culture 3D multicellular spheroid counterparts. Overall, our findings indicate that solvent-free, in-air produced 3D microgel microenvironments are cost-effective and robust tumor mimicking platforms for in vitro high-throughput screening of therapeutics targeted to prostate-to-bone metastasis microenvironments. Statement of Significance: The generation of robust microphysiological systems that recapitulate the complexity of the metastatic prostate-to-bone tumor microenvironment is crucial for pre-clinical evaluation of new therapeutics that can eradicate these secondary tumors. In this study, we employed superhydrophobic (SH) surfaces to rapidly fabricate photocrosslinkable hyaluronan-methacrylate/gelatin-methacrylate 3D spheroid microgels for prostate cancer cells and human osteoblasts co-culture models that simultaneously mimic the cellular and ECM tumor components. The use of SH platforms overcomes the issues of standard in-liquid microgel production technologies by providing a robust control over 3D microgels size/morphology and cell-cell co-encapsulation numbers, while avoiding the use of oil-based microgel droplets generation. Overall, SH surfaces allowed a solvent-free, cost-effective, reproducible and adaptable fabrication of heterotypic 3D spherical microgels for high throughput drug screening. © 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.","3D in vitro tumor models; Drug screening; Spherical microgels; Superhydrophobic surface","calcium; cisplatin; gelatin; hyaluronic acid; methacrylic acid; polystyrene; Article; bone metastasis; bone mineralization; cell count; cell density; cell heterogeneity; cell viability; coculture; controlled study; cross linking; cytotoxicity; drug screening; high throughput screening; human; human cell; hydrogel; in vitro study; male; microfluidics; multicellular spheroid; nanofabrication; osteoblast; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostate cancer cell line; tumor microenvironment; tumor spheroid; tumor volume; biological model; bone tumor; chemistry; coculture; drug screening; hydrogel; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; prostate tumor; tumor microenvironment; Bone Neoplasms; Coculture Techniques; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Humans; Hydrogels; Male; Models, Biological; Neoplasm Metastasis; PC-3 Cells; Prostatic Neoplasms; Spheroids, Cellular; Tumor Microenvironment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067296733

Nevertheless, a major challenge is the quality assurance of the AM fabricated parts. While there are several ways of approaching this problem, how to develop informative process signatures to detect part anomalies for quality control is still an open question. The objective of this study is to build a new layer-wise process signature model to characterize the thermal-defect relationship. Based on melt pool images, we propose novel layer-wise key process signatures, which are calculated using multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) and are directly correlated with the layer-wise quality of the part. The resultant layer-wise quality features can be used to predict the overall defect distribution of a fabricated layer during the build. The proposed model is validated through a case study based on a direct laser deposition experiment, where the layer-wise quality of the part is predicted on the fly. The accuracy of prediction is calculated using three measures (i.e., recall, precision, and F-score), showing reasonable success of the proposed methodology in predicting layer-wise quality. The proposed quality prediction methodology enables online process correction to eliminate anomalies and to ultimately improve the quality of the fabricated parts. © 2019 Journal of Manufacturing Science and Engineering, Transactions of the ASME.

The imager is fabricated in a standard front side illuminated 0.18μ m CMOS image sensor process. Each pixel comprises a 25μ m diameter SPAD, a variable-load passive quenching circuit implemented with 1.8 V PMOS, an 8-bit counter, an 8-bit latch register, and digital processing electronics, and feeds an 8-bit output bus. The array delivers two-dimensional intensity data through photon counting, with integration time as low as 5μ s over the full dynamic range. Per-pixel digital memory enables fully parallel processing and global-shutter mode readout. The imager can acquire fast optical events at high frame rate (up to 200 kfps) and at single-photon sensitivity. The imager has an 8-pixel (64-bit) parallel output bus. This imager enables for the first time the detection and arrival-direction determination of individual muzzle flashes in real time, and even in the case of bursts of flashes, at a moderate cost and size.

We present an additive manufacturing approach for the digital fabrication of tissue-like aortic heart valves featuring customizable geometry and leaflet architectures that resemble those of native valve tissue. Using biocompatible silicones with tunable mechanical properties, heart valves were fabricated by combining spray and extrusion-based additive manufacturing processes. Computer simulations showed that bioinspired leaflet architectures strongly affect the stress distribution throughout the valves, minimizing stresses on the leaflet during a cardiac cycle. Our computational analysis was complemented by in vitro experiments in a pulse duplicator to demonstrate the outstanding hemodynamic performance of the printed heart valves under physiological pressure cycles. The ability to fabricate synthetic implants with tailored designs at multiple length scales is a key contribution toward the digital fabrication of functional implants that perform on par with native body parts. Current heart valve solutions are expensive and labor intensive to manufacture, have relatively short life spans, contain animal-derived tissue or metallic elements that require immunosuppression or antithrombogenic drugs, and tend not to fit perfectly into the patient's aorta. As such, the number of patients who can receive such replacements is limited. Heart valves customized to fit the anatomy of the patient, match the softness of surrounding tissue, and adapt to the pathology and growth of diseased host tissue represent the next frontier in treatment. Using silicone valves as a model system, we additively manufactured patient-specific, bioinspired designs, effective for in vitro disease modeling and physical simulators. Furthermore, the technology we demonstrate offers a unique potential to create tissue-engineered constructs that closely resemble the architecture and functionality of their biological counterparts, providing mechanical cues to induce the controlled growth of cells. Here we present a multi-material additive manufacturing approach for fabricating personalized polymeric aortic heart valves and surrounding vasculature, derived from a patient's CT data. The valves feature geometries and fiber-reinforced leaflet architectures that resemble those of native valve tissue, along with materials that match the hardness and modulus of specific features. The designs are first simulated to predict the stresses and deformations in the valve, and subsequently the fabricated valves are tested in vitro to show excellent hydrodynamic properties. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","auxetic aortic stent; conformal 3D printing; direct ink writing; fiber reinforced; MAP 6: Development; multi-axis; multi-material; patient specific; polymeric heart valve; silicone; spray deposition","3D printers; Additives; Biocompatibility; Biomechanics; Blood vessels; Fabrication; Fiber reinforced materials; Fits and tolerances; Heart; Patient treatment; Polymeric implants; Reinforcement; Silicones; Tissue; Valves (mechanical); 3-D printing; auxetic aortic stent; Fiber reinforced; Heart valves; Multi materials; Multi-Axis; Patient specific; Spray deposition; Tissue engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077067421

On the internet, a huge amount of information competes for our (limited) attention. Moreover, despite the increasing quantity of contents, quality may be poor, making the environment particularly florid for misinformation spreading. In such a context, our cognitive biases emerge, first and foremost, confirmation bias, i.e. the human tendency to look for information that is already in agreement with one's system of beliefs. To shade light on the phenomenon, we present a collection of works investigating how information gets consumed and shapes communities on Facebook. We find that confirmation bias plays a crucial role in content selection and diffusion, and we provide empirical evidence of the existence of echo chambers, i.e. well separated and polarised groups of like-minded users sharing a same narrative. Immersed in these bubbles, users keep framing and reinforcing their world view, ignoring information dissenting from their preferred narrative. In this scenario, corrections in the form of fact-checking or debunking attempts seem to fail and have instead a backfire effect. To contrast misinformation, smoothing polarisation is so essential, and may require the design of tailored counter-narratives and appropriate communication strategies, particularly for sensitive topics. © 2019 European Food Safety Authority.

The active quench and recharge circuit with a feedback loop is proposed to reduce the dead time. A dual-counter-based time-to-digital converter is designed to prevent counting errors caused by the metastability of the counter in the time-to-digital converter.

Although effective in the lab, they are relatively untested in online experiments, and the quality of responses is largely unexplored. Closed-ended questions are easier to use online because they generally require only single key- or mouse-press responses and are less cognitively demanding, but they can bias the responses. We compared the data quality obtained using open and closed response formats using the continued-influence effect (CIE), in which participants read a series of statements about an unfolding event, one of which is unambiguously corrected later. Participants typically continue to refer to the corrected misinformation when making inferential statements about the event. We implemented this basic procedure online (Exp. 1A, n = 78), comparing standard open-ended responses to an alternative procedure using closed-ended responses (Exp. 1B, n = 75). Finally, we replicated these findings in a larger preregistered study (Exps. 2A and 2B, n = 323). We observed the CIE in all conditions: Participants continued to refer to the misinformation following a correction, and their references to the target misinformation were broadly similar in number across open- and closed-ended questions.

Rumor as unverified information also considerably spreads in social networks. The study of how rumor spreads and how it can be controlled, plays an important role in reducing social and psychological damages of rumor in social networks. Although recent researches have mainly focused on epidemic models and structure of social networks, they ignore the impact of people's decision on rumor process. In this paper, an evolutionary game model is proposed to analyze the rumor process in social network considering the impacts of people's decisions on rumor propagation and control. The model considers a rumor control mechanism via sending anti-rumor messages through rumor control centers. Factors affecting the people's decisions including social anxiety, people's attitude toward rumor/anti-rumor, strength of rumor/anti-rumor, influence of rumor control centers, and participation of people in discussions are studied in the model. The proposed game model is analyzed by replicator dynamics equations and simulation of the imitation update rule on a synthetic (Barabasi–Albert) and two real-world graphs of Twitter and Facebook. We further analyze the model in various environments considering people characteristics and society situation. Also we use a real rumor dataset of Twitter (Pheme dataset) to first compare the trends of people strategies (rumor/anti-rumor spreader and ignorant) derived by the model with the real trends of the traits of people in the rumor spreading on Twitter. Then we conduct a number of sensitivity analysis experiments to show the impact of different factors on rumor process. In fact, we analyze the trends of people strategies in Pheme dataset assuming various possible conditions. The analysis show that propagation of convincing anti-rumor messages and locating rumor control centers impact debunking the rumor. Moreover, it is shown that people attitude toward rumor/anti-rumor has significant impact on rumor spreading. Besides, factors such as social anxiety and strength of rumor accelerates rumor propagation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Evolutionary game; Rumor control; Rumor propagation; Social network","Social networking (online); Evolutionary game models; Evolutionary games; Psychological damage; Real-world graphs; Recent researches; Replicator dynamics; Rumor propagation; Sharing information; Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062010265

Research on miscarriages of justice and misleading evidence, as well as various inquires in the UK and the US, have highlighted human error as an issue within forensic science. This has led to increased attention to the sources of cognitive bias and potential countermeasures within many forensic disciplines. However, the area of digital forensics has yet to pay sufficient attention to this issue. The main goal of this article is to contribute to a more scientifically sound digital forensics domain by addressing the issues of cognitive bias as a source of error. In this paper we present an analysis of seven sources of cognitive and human error specifically within the digital forensics process, and discuss relevant countermeasures. We conclude that although some cognitive and bias issues are very similar across forensic domains, others are different and dependent on the specific characteristic of the domain in question, such as digital forensics.

This used neural networks to predict fuzzy soil class weightings based upon site descriptors from existing soil survey data. The intention of this work was to produce a set of soil maps for Scotland, which provide greater spatial resolution mapping than currently available, and provide fuzzy data to be used in mapping of ecosystem services using a novel approach explained in a second paper. When selecting the class with the highest weighting for test data points, Producer's Accuracy of 70.7% was achieved in mapping the broadest classification (five classes), while Producer's Accuracy levels of 59.9% and 43.7% were achieved for 11 and 30 classes, respectively. Evaluation of confusion matrices generated from the neural network model tests showed that, particularly for the classification systems with 11 and 30 classes, misclassification errors were more common between similar soil classes than between classes that were very different from one another. This implies that straightforward estimation of classification accuracy that measures “correct” and “incorrect” gives misleading results, and that the fuzzy classification maps are more useful than the crisp classification accuracy values. These fuzzy classification maps are therefore potentially useful for evaluating ecosystem services relating to soil type. We conclude that the mapping approach used here provides a classification accuracy comparable to other approaches and that the outputs can be used for mapping soil properties, processes, functions and ecosystem services. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science","digital soil mapping; land management; remote sensing; soil classification; spatial resolution","accuracy assessment; artificial neural network; digital mapping; ecosystem service; fuzzy mathematics; land management; remote sensing; soil classification; soil ecosystem; soil survey; spatial resolution; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065762844

In two online studies we investigated how different ways of communicating the current uptake of 43% of the English Bowel Scope Screening (BSS) programme affects intention among disinclined men and women. Methods: In the first study, 202 participants were asked to interpret eight quantifiers for 43% uptake ('few', 'many', 'a considerable number', 'a large number', 'a great number', 'a lot', 'numerous' and 'nearly half') and to indicate how misleading they perceived each of them to be. In the second study, with 1245 participants, we compared the motivational impact of two quantifiers ('a large number' and 'nearly half' which were associated with the highest perceived uptake (48.9%) and considered least misleading in study 1 respectively) with a control message that did not contain any information on uptake, and a message which communicated actual uptake as a proportion (43%). Results: While we found that both verbal quantifiers increased screening intentions compared with the control group (from 7.8 to 12.5%, aOR 1.72; 95%CI 1.00-2.96 in the case of 'a large number' and 14.3%, aOR 2.02; 95%CI 1.20-3.38 for 'nearly half'), simply communicating that 43% do the test, however, had no impact on intentions (9.9% vs. 7.8% aOR 1.25; 95%CI 0.73-2.16).

Methods: A YouTube search was performed on https://www.youtube.com/ for videos pertaining to “retinopathy of prematurity” and “ROP.” The first 100 relevant videos were included in the study. Two ophthalmologist reviewers independently evaluated and classified the videos as useful or misleading. The videos were accepted as “useful,” if they provide scientifically correct information about any aspect of ROP: cause, pathogenesis, symptoms, findings, treatments, procedure details of the treatment, epidemiology, and prognosis. The videos contain scientifically unproven information are defined as “misleading.” Videos were also classified according to the source: surgeon/practitioner, independent user, hospital/free clinic, social media/TV, medical site, university, and advertisement. Results: The mean duration, the mean days on YouTube, the mean comments per videos, and the mean dislikes per video were similar in useful and misleading videos. However, the mean likes per day, mean view per video, and mean view per day were significantly higher in useful videos than those of misleading videos (p = 0.004, p = 0.022, and p = 0.011, respectively). Most of the useful videos were uploaded by healthcare professionals including source from university, hospital/free clinic, and surgeon/practitioner (48/64). The videos uploaded by healthcare professionals were more useful compared to those of non-healthcare professionals (p = 0.029). Conclusion: YouTube could be used as an important tool for patient information in ROP. However, one third of the YouTube videos regarding ROP are misleading and may present a risk of harmful consequences. In this aspect, authoritative videos by healthcare professionals should be uploaded for dissemination of reliable information on ROP. © 2018, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.","Patient information; Retinopathy of prematurity; YouTube videos","Article; clinical evaluation; epidemiological data; health care quality; hospital cost; human; internet access; medical examination; medical information; online analysis; ophthalmologist; pathogenesis; patient information; prognosis; retrolental fibroplasia; social media; symptom assessment; treatment duration; treatment indication; videorecording; devices; information dissemination; pathology; procedures; retrolental fibroplasia; Humans; Information Dissemination; Retinopathy of Prematurity; Social Media",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053771006

However, few studies have empirically examined whether temporal self-boosting rating manipulation changes the follow-up dynamic pattern of online ratings. This study empirically identifies manipulated ratings and examines how this manipulation influences the evolution of follow-up ratings over time. Rating records of more than 30,000 restaurants are extracted from the server log of a restaurant review website. The results show a statistically nonsignificant difference in the average rating scores between before and after manipulation, indicating that manipulation does not influence follow-up rating dynamics. Moreover, the difference in average ratings between before and after manipulation decreases within a long time window, which indicates that the long-term effect is weaker than the short-term one. The results are further validated by an online field experiment. We then construct a simulation model to reveal the underlying mechanisms of why the follow-up raters could correct the bias of rating manipulation. The manipulated high-rating score of the vendor will increase the diversity of consumers’ individual preferences, which leads to diverse evaluations among users. The aggregation of online ranking by taking the average score of ratings helps form a decentralized climate of opinion and finally helps correct the biased rating. This study challenges the common belief that self-boosting misinformation affects the performance of online commerce. The nonsignificant effect of rating manipulation on rating dynamics echoes the theory of the wisdom of crowds. Furthermore, this study has managerial implications for both online vendors and online rating platforms. We suggested that the system should degrade social influences among users in order to reduce the possible impacts by manipulated ratings. © 2019","Moving average; Rating dynamics; Rating manipulation; Wisdom of crowds","Dynamics; Electronic commerce; Individual preference; Long-term effects; Managerial implications; Moving averages; Online rating systems; Restaurant reviews; Social influence; Wisdom of crowds; Online systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060997883

However, it is impossible to understand individual information processing and acceptance without taking into account social networks, information ecologies, and other macro-level variables that provide important social context. Specifically, we show how being misinformed is a function of a person’s ability and motivation to spot falsehoods, but also of other group-level and societal factors that increase the chances of citizens to be exposed to correct(ive) information. We conclude by discussing a number of research areas—some of which echo themes of the 2017 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Communicating Science Effectively report—that will be particularly important for our future understanding of misinformation, specifically a systems approach to the problem of misinformation, the need for more systematic analyses of science communication in new media environments, and a (re)focusing on traditionally underserved audiences. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

To date, efforts have centered on improving the content, accessibility, and delivery of scientific communications. Here we argue that in the current political and media environment faulty communication is no longer the core of the problem. Distrust in the scientific enterprise and misperceptions of scientific knowledge increasingly stem less from problems of communication and more from the widespread dissemination of misleading and biased information. We describe the profound structural shifts in the media environment that have occurred in recent decades and their connection to public policy decisions and technological changes. We explain how these shifts have enabled unscrupulous actors with ulterior motives increasingly to circulate fake news, misinformation, and disinformation with the help of trolls, bots, and respondent-driven algorithms. We document the high degree of partisan animosity, implicit ideological bias, political polarization, and politically motivated reasoning that now prevail in the public sphere and offer an actual example of how clearly stated scientific conclusions can be systematically perverted in the media through an internet-based campaign of disinformation and misinformation. We suggest that, in addition to attending to the clarity of their communications, scientists must also develop online strategies to counteract campaigns of misinformation and disinformation that will inevitably follow the release of findings threatening to partisans on either end of the political spectrum. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

In particular, this study explored how a 3D-printed PCL mesh performs as a bioabsorbable scaffold after a long period following implantation. Methods: A retrospective review of 101 patients who received primary or secondary rhinoplasty with a PCL mesh was performed. Patient demographics and surgery-related outcomes were examined. Clinical efficacy and safety were evaluated using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale at postoperative 18 months. From two revisional cases, a biopsy specimen of implanted PCL was acquired and histopathological analysis was performed. Results: Of all the patients, 98.0% showed no postoperative infection-related foreign body reaction or distinct abnormal reaction, and the implants were observed to maintain long-term efficacy until 18-month follow-up. In patients who received spreader grafts, significant differences between preoperative and postoperative Cottle sign scores were found. Histopathological analysis showed features of adjacent tissue infiltration into pores of the PCL mesh and regeneration of neo-cartilaginous tissue and collagen around the mesh 20 months after implantation. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that a novel biodegradable PCL mesh with a 3D structure is a safe and effective material for corrective rhinoplasty because it is easy to use and capable of maintaining its volume in the long term without foreign body response.

Several important influencing factors are examined and illustrated. User information from the most recent posted microblog content of 3793 Sina Weibo users was collected. Natural language processing (NLP) was used for the sentiment and short text similarity analyses, and four machine learning techniques, i.e., logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were compared on different rumor refuting microblogs; after which a valid and robust distinguishing XGBoost model was trained and validated to predict who would retweet disaster-related rumor refuting microblogs. Compared with traditional prediction variables that only access user information, the similarity and sentiment analyses of the most recent user microblog contents were found to significantly improve prediction precision and robustness. The number of user microblogs also proved to be a valuable reference for all samples during the prediction process. This prediction methodology could be possibly more useful for WeChat or Facebook as these have relatively stable closed-loop communication channels, which means that rumors are more likely to be refuted by acquaintances. Therefore, the methodology is going to be further optimized and validated on WeChat-like channels in the future. The novel rumor refuting approach presented in this research harnessed NLP for the user microblog content analysis and then used the analysis results of NLP as additional prediction variables to identify the anti-rumor spreaders. Therefore, compared to previous studies, this study presents a new and effective decision support for rumor countermeasures. © 2019 by the authors.","Disaster-related; Group behavior; Machine learning; NLP; Rumor refutation; XGBoost","decision support system; group behavior; machine learning; precision; prediction; social media; article; content analysis; controlled study; decision support system; disaster; human; natural language processing; prediction; random forest; social media; support vector machine; machine learning; statistical model; Disasters; Humans; Logistic Models; Machine Learning; Social Media; Support Vector Machine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065319345

Often, these opinions are of a competing nature, e.g., radical vs. peaceful ideologies, correct information vs. misinformation, and one technology vs. another. We study the battles of such competing opinions over evolving social networks. The novelty of our model is that it captures the exposure and adoption dynamics of opinions that account for the preferential and random nature of exposure as well as the persuasion power and persistence of different opinions. We provide a complete characterization of the mean opinion dynamics over time as a function of the initial adoption, as well as the particular exposure, adoption, and persistence dynamics.

The components of emergency communication, from situational awareness, to response coordination and public information provision are influenced by factors that are fundamentally different from 20 or even ten years ago. It is a fastevolving environment, involving new technologies and changing communication preferences. Adapting to a highly dynamic and demanding information environment takes up resources from other activities. One response to this rapid change has been the establishment of Virtual Operation Support Teams to monitor social media, support situational awareness, counter rumours and disseminate official communication. To date, the establishment, utility and added value of these teams has not been the subject of research. This paper examines the evolution of Virtual Operation Support Teams across the globe and how they are being used in seven countries. The paper suggests ways that governments and emergency management authorities can support similar teams and how integration with formal operations might be managed.

Also, buyers use it to choose an appropriate seller among a set of alternatives. The standard practice of determining the reputation of a seller is the aggregation of the feedbacks or the ratings reported by its buyers. Such a model of reputation formulation is vulnerable to misleading and unfair feedbacks. A seller may collude with a set of buyers to report good feedbacks while the quality of its product is poor. Also the buyers can report unfair feedbacks being irrational, malicious or competitors. A robust reputation management mechanism is the one which can not be manipulated by these unfair feedbacks. The existing reputation management models are either reactive or proactive. The reactive solutions intend to identify the unfair feedbacks and the proactive solutions propose incentive to the buyers to encourage them to report fair feedbacks. In this paper, we propose an incentive system that encourages the buyers to report fair feedbacks. We associate a buyer’s reputation with a seller’s reputation if the buyer has expressed its feedback about the seller. If the reputation of the seller decreases then the reputation of all buyers who had endorsed it (provided positive feedbacks) also decreases and vice versa. This means a buyer risks its own reputation by providing the feedback about a seller. In this paper, we show that such a mechanism is incentive compatible, i.e., it encourages the buyers to provide fair feedbacks. Using analytical and experimental analysis, we show the correctness of this reputation management system. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","e-marketplace; Reputation; Trust",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035802789

An additional complexity is that there can be different types of false information that travel from and through different communities who respond in various ways within the same social media conversation. Here we present a case study/example analysis exploring the speed and reach of three different types of false stories found in the Black Panther movie Twitter conversation and comparing the diffusion of these stories with the community responses to them. We find that the negative reaction to fake stories of racially-motivated violence whether in the form of debunking quotes or satirical posts can spread at speeds that are magnitudes higher than the original fake stories. Satire posts, while less viral than debunking quotes, appear to have longer lifetimes in the conversation. We also found that the majority of mixed community members who originally spread fake stories switched to attacking them.

However, the development is followed by a lot of tough questions like the management and storage of the nuclear waste. ADS, which is short for the accelerator-driven sub-critical system, may be a good choice because it can provide an efficient transmutations of nuclear waste. Many countries have carried out some research in related areas like the USA, Japan and China. The superconducting magnet system: The cryomodule I (CM1) for China’s ADS Injection-I had been designed, fabricated and online tested. The CM1 is mainly composed of superconducting spoke cavities, beam position monitors, cryogenic system and superconducting magnets. The superconducting magnet system, which includes the magnet and current leads, is aimed at focusing and correcting the proton beams. Conclusion: Seven superconducting magnets and current leads for CM1 are successfully designed and manufactured. Structural strength meets design specifications, the field meets the design demands, and the online test shows that the magnets can work in a rather stable state.

They hold great potential to promote a new generation of wearable devices and thin optical systems for imaging and sensing. However, due to the diffractive nature of these metasurfaces, chromatic aberration represents a critical challenge toward practical implementations, especially for the visible spectrum. Existing solutions for multi-wavelength meta-optics inevitably increase the device thickness and system complexity, similar to the conventional refractive and diffractive counterparts. They are also limited to polarization sensitive lenses with a small size and numerical aperture (NA). In this manuscript, we present the design of single-layer multi-wavelength metasurfaces using ultrathin dielectric resonators (thickness wavelength) as structural elements. The electromagnetic response of these resonators can be tailored by the in-plane geometrical parameters and used to manipulate the transmitted light. We introduce a digital transmission modulation scheme which enables opportunities to design multi-wavelength optics beyond conventional binary diffractive optics. The design versatility of our approach is demonstrated by polarization-independent achromatic metalenses with a larger lens size and larger NA than existing approaches. The simplicity of the design and fabrication process makes these ultrathin metasurfaces good candidates for building flat optical elements that can be easily integrated onto CMOS electronics and MEMS devices. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Dielectric devices; Geometrical optics; Geometry; Polarization; Resonators; Binary diffractive optics; Chromatic aberration; Digital transmission; Electromagnetic response; Fabrication process; Incident illumination; Polarization independent; Polarization sensitive; Aberrations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062211185

We investigate one potential approach: having social media platform algorithms preferentially display content from news sources that users rate as trustworthy. To do so, we ask whether crowdsourced trust ratings can effectively differentiate more versus less reliable sources. We ran two preregistered experiments (n = 1,010 from Mechanical Turk and n = 970 from Lucid) where individuals rated familiarity with, and trust in, 60 news sources from three categories: (i) mainstream media outlets, (ii) hyperpartisan websites, and (iii) websites that produce blatantly false content (“fake news”). Despite substantial partisan differences, we find that laypeople across the political spectrum rated mainstream sources as far more trustworthy than either hyperpartisan or fake news sources. Although this difference was larger for Democrats than Republicans—mostly due to distrust of mainstream sources by Republicans—every mainstream source (with one exception) was rated as more trustworthy than every hyperpartisan or fake news source across both studies when equally weighting ratings of Democrats and Republicans. Furthermore, politically balanced layperson ratings were strongly correlated (r = 0.90) with ratings provided by professional fact-checkers. We also found that, particularly among liberals, individuals higher in cognitive reflection were better able to discern between low- and high-quality sources. Finally, we found that excluding ratings from participants who were not familiar with a given news source dramatically reduced the effectiveness of the crowd. Our findings indicate that having algorithms up-rank content from trusted media outlets may be a promising approach for fighting the spread of misinformation on social media. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

This paper explores two case studies of pro-vaccine activism in Australia and the United States (US). It shows how pro-vaccine views and behaviours can take varying forms due to different aims and methods of engagement – oppositional counteractivities in favour of vaccination in Australia, and issue-based advocacy as part of a political alliance in the US. The focus in Australia comes from a pro-science stance and includes 'skeptics’ against pseudoscience directly opposing vaccine-critical groups. In the US, the focus takes the form of an issue-specific campaign that has arisen from existing pro-vaccine parent blogs and discussion groups pushing for policy change rather than public confrontation. These case studies exemplify how pro-vaccine activism can take varying forms of either reinforcing the mainstream view or countering digression from it. Drawing on qualitative research, this paper aims to examine the types of practices and strategies employed by activists to voice their support of vaccination, and discusses the means, messages, and motivations of pro-vaccine activism. It ends with an argument for why a study – of public support for in addition to studying public opposition to vaccination – can help to better understand vaccination views and behaviours. These findings have wider implications for the study of counter-activism and the polarisation of civil society groups. © 2018","Activism; Anti-Vaccine; Australia; Civil society; Pro-vaccine; Social movement; United States; Vaccination policy","civil society; policy approach; social movement; vaccination; vaccine; advocacy group; anti-vaccination movement; Article; attitude to change; Australia; blogging; decision support system; health care policy; human; measles; medical practice; motivation; political activism; provocation; public health campaign; public health message; public opinion; qualitative research; reinforcement; United States; vaccination; consumer advocacy; cultural factor; health care policy; interview; psychology; public opinion; vaccination; Australia; United States; vaccine; Australia; Consumer Advocacy; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Health Policy; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Public Opinion; Qualitative Research; United States; Vaccination; Vaccines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059237123

However, cognitive bias can sometimes mislead investigators into modeling fictitious compounds without solid support from the electron density maps. Ligand identification can be aided by automatic methods, but existing approaches are based on time-consuming iterative fitting. Results Here we report a new machine learning algorithm called CheckMyBlob that identifies ligands from experimental electron density maps. In benchmark tests on portfolios of up to 219 931 ligand binding sites containing the 200 most popular ligands found in the Protein Data Bank, CheckMyBlob markedly outperforms the existing automatic methods for ligand identification, in some cases doubling the recognition rates, while requiring significantly less time. Our work shows that machine learning can improve the automation of structure modeling and significantly accelerate the drug screening process of macromolecule-ligand complexes.

In light of marketplace changes (i.e. labeling requirements), we explore behavioral measures based on labeling options. Design/methodology/approach: Three studies, one online projective survey using a convenience sample of consumers and two experiments conducted with Amazon mTurk adult US participants, are included. Findings: Consumers have negative associations with GM products vs non-GM and are more likely to purchase unlabeled GM products. GM products may offer positive economic, societal and environmental benefits. However, the need for labeling overshadows these benefits and presence of GM labeling increased avoidance. Furthermore, changes in product opinion mediate consumers’ purchase intention and willingness to pay. Research limitations/implications: GM labeling negatively influences consumers’ opinions and behavioral intentions. This is important for legislators and marketers concerned with counter-labeling effects (e.g. Non-GMO Project Verified). Practical implications: Debates on efficacy of labeling, inclusion disclosure of ingredients, short-term risks and long-term implications are ongoing globally. Consumer reception and purchase intention can only be changed through governmental and corporate transparency. Social implications: Widespread misinformation about GM foods, presence in our food supply, impact on health, economy, environment and the marketplace still exists. The findings reflect consumers’ responses to changes proposed by the 2016 National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard legislation. Originality/value: With the paucity of research on consumer response to the release of a GM animal product into the food supply, this work breaks new ground as the first to examine the impact of disclosure of GM animal-based food type. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer perceptions; Genetically modified food; Ingredient disclosure; Labelling; Online experiments; Projective technique",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060708149

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a mixed-method approach, using a brand situation as a case example, including sentiment analysis of social media conversations and sentiment analysis of media coverage. This study tracks the diffusion of a false claim about the brand via online media coverage, subsequent spreading of the false claim via social media and the resulting impact on sentiment toward the brand. Findings: The findings illustrate the influence of digital mass communication sources on the subsequent spread of information about a brand via social media channels and the impact of the social spread of false claims on brand sentiment. This study illustrates the value of social media listening and sentiment analysis for brands as an ongoing business practice. Research limitations/implications: While it has long been known that media coverage is in part subsequently diffused through individual sharing, this study reveals the potential for media sentiment to influence sentiment toward a brand. It also illustrates the potential harm brands face when false information is spread via media coverage and subsequently through social media posts and conversations. How brands can most effectively correct false brand beliefs and recover from negative sentiment related to false claims is an area for future research. Practical implications: This study suggests that brands are wise to use sentiment analysis as part of their evaluation of earned media coverage from news organizations and to use social listening as an alert system and sentiment analysis to assess impact on attitudes toward the brand. These steps should become part of a brand’s social media management process. Social implications: Media are presumed to be impartial reporters of news and information. However, this study illustrated that the sentiment expressed in media coverage about a brand can be measured and diffused beyond the publications’ initial reach via social media. Advertising positioned as news must be labeled as “advertorial” to ensure that those exposed to the message understand that the message is not impartial. News organizations may inadvertently publish false claims and relay information with sentiment that is then carried via social media along with the information itself. Negative information about a brand may be more sensational and, thus, prone to social sharing, no matter how well the findings are researched or sourced. Originality/value: The value of the study is its illustration of how false information and media sentiment spread via social media can ultimately affect consumer sentiment and attitude toward the brand. This study also explains the research process for social scraping and sentiment analysis. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Earned media; eWOM; Rumors; Sentiment analysis; Social listening; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061646380

We study the rumor spreading process with the proposed reinforcement diffusion mechanism on two typical networks. The outbreak thresholds of rumor spreading on both two networks are obtained.

The technique chosen to gather information was the collection and document analysis of articles on this topic. The results allow concluding that, if correctly used, virtual channels have a high potential for science communication, thus helping it reach a wider public beyond other scientists/the academic community.

The analysis focuses specifically upon how such contests are manifested in the aftermath of terror events illuminated by two distinct data sources. These are empirical data collected from interviews with policy developers and deliverers, together with material derived from systematic monitoring and assessment of social media following four terror attacks in the UK in 2017. It is suggested that such incidents are singularly important moments because they simultaneously evidence the need for Prevent-type interventions, but also such interventions' apparent failures to stop such violence. A key theme for the article concerns how, situated in the contemporary information environment, a key strand of Prevent work conducted in the wake of terrorist violence involves managing the potential impacts of rumours, conspiracy theories and other disinformation. The management of public perceptions and reputation thus emerge as vital undertakings. Insights from the data are used to develop a more conceptually oriented argument concerning the logics and rationalities of ‘counter-governance’, positioning it in a wider literature on de-centred governance and regulation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Conspiracy; Counter-governance; Counter-terrorism; Disinformation; Prevent; Rumour",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076237440

Alas, attempts to debunk misinformation have proven sub-optimal, and have even been shown to “backfire”, including increasing misperceptions. Thus, optimized debunking strategies have been developed to more effectively combat misinformation. The aim of this study was to test these strategies in a real-world setting, targeting misinformation about autism interventions. In the context of professional development training, we randomly assigned participants to an “optimized-debunking” or a “treatment-as-usual” training condition and compared support for non-empirically-supported treatments before, after, and six weeks following completion of online training. Results demonstrated greater benefits of optimized debunking immediately after training; thus, the implemented strategies can serve as a general and flexible debunking template. However, the effect was not sustained at follow-up, highlighting the need for further research into strategies for sustained change. © 2019 Paynter et al.

Data was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Content analysis was employed to analyze the data.Two themes emerged about the adolescents: 1) social situations to rationalize sexual behaviors, which comprised peer imitation regarding sexual intercourse, online sexual relationships, drinking alcohol before having sex, living with a boyfriend/girlfriend without marriage, and having multiple partners, and 2) factors related to sexual risk behaviors, including adolescent norms regarding sexual risk, misinformation regarding sexual risk prevention,uninvolved parenting style, lack of teaching skills to convey sex education, potential risk environment in the community, and community norms regarding males’ sexual behavior.Results indicated that correct and effective sexually transmitted infection prevention methods, gender equality, and motivation for condom use are important to prevent adolescent sexual risk behaviors.

The 2017-2019 Italian National Vaccination Plan promotes the improvement of knowledge and attitudes of healthcare workers about vaccine prevention, in order to spread a vaccination culture among general population. Similarly to the General Practitioner, the Pharmacist represents a fundamental forefront for both patients and healthy people, also in promoting vaccine acceptance. This research aims to analyze knowledge and attitudes about vaccines of Community Pharmacists and to evaluate the burden of vaccination counselling during their work activities. Material and methods. A standardized, self-administered and previously validated questionnaire, including 5 sections and 28 items, was submitted to a sample of Community Pharmacists working in Western Sicily. The survey was carried out through an online questionnaire, that investigated socio-demographic data, knowledge and attitudes towards vaccination and the role of the Pharmacist as vaccination counselor during his work. Results. A total of 120 Pharmacists were surveyed. 99.2% of them were definitely agreed with the Regional Vaccination Schedule. A large majority (n = 114, or 95%) were fully vaccinated and have vaccinated, or would vaccinate in future, their children. According to Community Pharmacists interviewed, at least 90% of clients asked for further explanations about vaccination, and the citizens' trust towards vaccination increased (30%) or remained stable (54.2%) over time in the last 5 years. Finally, as reported by interviewed Pharmacists, a correct counselling provided by General Practitioners (GPs) and Family Pediatricians was the main boost in increasing vaccination confidence, instead of mass-media and web misinformation that has led to skepticisms among general population. Conclusions. The study demonstrated the key role of the Community Pharmacist for their consumers in vaccination counselling. In future, a strong collaboration between Community Pharmacists and all the actors promoting vaccination themes (GPs, family Pediatricians, public health workers) will be essential, as well as a uniform and standardized University training on vaccination themes for all these categories. © 2019 Societa Editrice Universo.","Community pharmacist; Health-care workers; Pharmacy; Vaccination; Vaccination counselling","adult; aged; attitude to health; female; general practitioner; health care survey; human; male; middle aged; pediatrician; pharmacist; pharmacy (shop); preventive health service; professional standard; Sicily; Adult; Aged; Community Pharmacy Services; Female; General Practitioners; Health Care Surveys; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Immunization Programs; Male; Middle Aged; Pediatricians; Pharmacists; Professional Role; Sicily",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064983310

Once the metamaterials are fabricated, their functions become fixed or tunable. Recently, the concept of digital metamaterials has been introduced, in which, for instance, the constitutive 1-bit meta-atom is digitalized as ""0"" or ""1"" corresponding to two opposite electromagnetic (EM) responses. The digital metamaterials set up a bridge between the physical world and the information world. More interestingly, when the digital meta-atom is programmable, a single metamaterial can be used to realize different functions when programmed with different coding sequences. Moreover, as the states of programmable meta-atoms can be quickly switched, it enables the wave-based information coding and processing on the physical level of metamaterials in real time. For these reasons, we prefer to call digital metamaterials with programmable meta-atoms as ""information metamaterials."" In this review article, we introduce two basic principles for information metamaterials: Shannon entropy on metamaterials to measure the information capacity quantitatively and digital convolution on metamaterials to manipulate the beam steering. Afterwards, two proof-of-concept imaging systems based on information metamaterials, i.e. programmable hologram and programmable imager, are presented, showing more powerful abilities than the traditional counterparts. Furthermore, we discuss the time-modulated information metamaterial that enables efficient and accurate manipulations of spectral harmonic distributions and brings new physical phenomena such as frequency cloaking and velocity illusion. As a relevant application of time-modulated information metamaterials, we propose a novel architecture of wireless communication, which simplifies the modern wireless communication system. Finally, the future trends of information metamaterials are predicted. © 2019 Tie Jun Cui et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2019.","digital coding metamaterials; information metamaterials; programmable hologram; programmable imager; time-space-coding metasurface","Atoms; Codes (symbols); Holograms; Real time systems; Digital coding; Information coding; Metasurface; Physical phenomena; Real-time information; Spectral harmonics; Wireless communication system; Wireless communications; Metamaterials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063726834

Background: Investigations conducted in the last decades have increased the technological resources used in orthodontics. This scientific advance applies to several clinical procedures, including the planning of devices used in guided surgeries, using computed tomography images and intraoral scanning. Case description: This case report presents maxillary expansion in an adult patient (18 years and 5 months), using the MARPE technique, by virtual planning and fabrication of a surgical guide (laser-printed on a 3D printer MoonRay D225-SprintRay, 2014), after merging of 3 files: digital file of the expander (. stl), computed tomography of the suture, and intraoral scanning of the patient, using the planning software NemoStudio (version 20122, 16.50.0.56). Conclusion: Fabrication of a surgical guide for the MARPE technique provides an accurate transfer of the virtual planning to the surgical procedure. It allows three-dimensional orientation of the expander position and perforations of mini-implants, which are necessary to establish anchorage in areas with sufficient bone, assuring the system stability and a successful procedure. Clinical significance: The mini-implant assisted rapid palatal expansion (MARPE) has been investigated as a promising option for correction of malocclusion related with maxillary atresia in adult patients and is an option to orthognathic surgery. Digital treatment planning is fundamental to establish individual, reproducible, and accurate parameters, as in the present case, which evidenced significant benefits in both occlusal and respiratory aspects. © The Author(s). 2019.","MARPE; Midpalatal suture; Rapid palatal expansion; Surgical guide","adult; case report; cone beam computed tomography; human; malocclusion; maxilla; orthodontic procedure; palatal expansion; palate; three dimensional imaging; Adult; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Malocclusion; Maxilla; Orthodontic Appliance Design; Palatal Expansion Technique; Palate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076032385

Methods: Over a 2-year period, all patients presenting to a private dental clinic with a removable complete denture in the maxilla, seeking rehabilitation with implants, were considered for inclusion in this study. Inclusion criteria were fully edentulous maxilla, functional problems with the preexisting denture, opposing dentition, and sufficient bone volume to insert four implants. Exclusion criteria were age < 55 years, need for bone augmentation, uncompensated diabetes mellitus, immunocompromised status, radio- and/or chemotherapy, and previous treatment with oral and/or intravenous aminobisphosphonates. All patients were rehabilitated with a maxillary overdenture supported by a CAD/CAM polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) implant-supported bar. The outcomes of the study were the passive fit/adaptation of the bar, the 1-year implant survival, and the success rates of the implant-supported overdentures. Results: 15 patients (6 males, 9 females; mean age 68.8 ± 4.7 years) received 60 implants and were rehabilitated with a maxillary overdenture supported by a PEEK bar, designed and milled from an intraoral digital impression. The intraoral scans were integrated with face scans, in order to design each bar with all available patient data (soft tissues, prosthesis, implants, and face) in the correct spatial position. When testing the 3D-printed resin bar, 12 bars out of 15 (80%) had a perfect passive adaptation and fit; in contrast, 3 out of 15 (20%) did not have a sufficient passive fit or adaptation. No implants were lost, for a 1-year survival of 100% (60/60 surviving implants). However, some complications (two fixtures with peri-implantitis in the same patient and two repaired overdentures in two different patients) occurred. This determined a 1-year success rate of 80% for the implant-supported overdenture. Conclusions: In this study, the combination of intraoral and face scans allowed to successfully restore fully edentulous patients with maxillary overdentures supported by 4 implants and a CAD/CAM PEEK bar. Further studies are needed to confirm these outcomes.",,"ketone; macrogol; polyetheretherketone; aged; chemistry; computer aided design; dental impression; devices; diagnostic imaging; edentulousness; female; human; implant-supported denture; male; maxilla; middle aged; overlay denture; pathology; procedures; prospective study; treatment outcome; x-ray computed tomography; Aged; Computer-Aided Design; Dental Impression Technique; Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported; Denture, Overlay; Female; Humans; Jaw, Edentulous; Ketones; Male; Maxilla; Middle Aged; Polyethylene Glycols; Prospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072277000

Here we demonstrate one mechanism that contributes to the believability of fake news: fluency via prior exposure. Using actual fake-news headlines presented as they were seen on Facebook, we show that even a single exposure increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy, both within the same session and after a week. Moreover, this ""illusory truth effect"" for fake-news headlines occurs despite a low level of overall believability and even when the stories are labeled as contested by fact checkers or are inconsistent with the reader's political ideology. These results suggest that social media platforms help to incubate belief in blatantly false news stories and that tagging such stories as disputed is not an effective solution to this problem. It is interesting, however, that we also found that prior exposure does not impact entirely implausible statements (e.g., ""The earth is a perfect square"").

Health organizations are required to respond and correct the information to gain the public’s trust and influence it to follow the recommended instructions. Objectives (1) To examine ways for health organizations to correct misinformation concerning the measles vaccination on social networks for two groups: pro-vaccination and hesitant; (2) To examine the types of reactions of two subgroups (pro-vaccination, hesitant) to misinformation correction; and (3) To examine the effect of misinformation correction on these two subgroups regarding reliability, satisfaction, self-efficacy and intentions. Methods A controlled experiment with participants divided randomly into two conditions. In both experiment conditions a dilemma was presented as to sending a child to kindergarten, followed by an identical Facebook post voicing the children mothers’ concerns. In the third stage the correction by the health organization is presented differently in two conditions: Condition 1 –common information correction, and Condition 2 –recommended (theory-based) information correction, mainly communicating information transparently and addressing the public’s concerns. The study included (n = 243) graduate students from the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at Haifa University. Results A statistically significant difference was found in the reliability level attributed to information correction by the Health Ministry between the Control condition and Experimental condition (sig<0.001), with the average reliability level of the subjects in Condition 2 (M = 5.68) being considerably higher than the average reliability level of subjects in Condition 1 (4.64). A significant difference was found between Condition 1 and Condition 2 (sig<0.001), with the average satisfaction from the Health Ministry’s response of Condition 2 subjects (M = 5.75) being significantly higher than the average satisfaction level of Condition 1 subjects (4.66). Similarly, when we tested the pro and hesitant groups separately, we found that both preferred the response presented in Condition 2. Conclusion It is very important for the organizations to correct misinformation transparently, and to address the emotional aspects for both the pro-vaccination and the hesitant groups. The pro-vaccination group is not a captive audience, and it too requires a full response that addresses the public’s fears and concerns. © 2018 Gesser-Edelsburg et al.

Communication, cognitive, social, and computer scientists are studying the complex causes for the viral diffusion of misinformation, while online platforms are beginning to deploy countermeasures. Little systematic, data-based evidence has been published to guide these efforts. Here we analyze 14 million messages spreading 400 thousand articles on Twitter during ten months in 2016 and 2017. We find evidence that social bots played a disproportionate role in spreading articles from low-credibility sources. Bots amplify such content in the early spreading moments, before an article goes viral. They also target users with many followers through replies and mentions. Humans are vulnerable to this manipulation, resharing content posted by bots. Successful low-credibility sources are heavily supported by social bots. These results suggest that curbing social bots may be an effective strategy for mitigating the spread of online misinformation. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"article; human; human experiment; information dissemination; information processing; interpersonal communication; procedures; social media; social network; standards; statistics and numerical data; Communication; Data Collection; Humans; Information Dissemination; Social Media; Social Networking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056802427

The most reliable method for determining GT needs expensive equipment, namely differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). An alternative method is digital photometry (DP) which uses an inexpensive digital camera and free-access image processing software to determine the alkali spreading value (ASV) and GT of milled rice. The starch gel area of the images of alkali-gelatinized grains was measured after a given gelatinization time; the images were then taken with a digital camera inside a fabricated light box and analyzed using ImageJ. Literature GT values based on DSC (GTDSC) for eight rice varieties were correlated with experimental values of relative increases in gel area after gelatinization, i.e., RIAi and RIAf based either on initial area or final area, respectively. The natural logarithm of RIAi (ln RIAi ) was found to be highly correlated with GTDSC values and was numerically equal (within experimental uncertainty) to published ASV values. The correlation equation of ln RIAi versus GTDSC allowed determination of GT values for three additional rice varieties and correctly predicted GT values for 29 rice varieties based on literature ASV data. Thus, DP can be used as a cheap and rapid method of estimating ASV and GT.DP values were similar to the conventional visual scoring method for ASV determination, but is less subjective, more precise and provides a permanent record of data. © 2018, College of Agriculture and Food Science, University of the Philippines Los Banos.

At the same time, unverified and instrumentally relevant information statements in circulation, named as rumours, are becoming a potential threat to the society. For this reason, although the identification in social microblogs of which topic is a rumour has been studied in several works, there is the need to detect if a post is either a rumor or not. In this paper we cope with this last challenge presenting a novel rumour detection system that leverages on newly designed features, including influence potential and network characteristics measures. We tested our approach on a real dataset composed of health-related posts collected from Twitter microblog.

In this paper, we investigate linguistic (especially emotional and topical) signals expressed in user comments in the presence of misinformation and fact-checking. We collect and analyze a dataset of 5,303 social media posts with 2,614,374 user comments from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, and associate these posts to fact-check articles from Snopes and PolitiFact for veracity rulings (i.e., from true to false). We find that linguistic signals in user comments vary significantly with the veracity of posts, e.g., we observe more misinformation-awareness signals and extensive emoji and swear word usage with falser posts. We further show that these signals can help to detect misinformation. In addition, we find that while there are signals indicating positive effects after fact-checking, there are also signals indicating potential “backfire” effects. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In the case of battery-powered application, high power consumption leads to reduction in the battery life and affects reliability, packaging and cooling costs,. With technology processes advancing towards deep submicron and nano regimes, the scaling down of the threshold voltage levels in turn causes an exponential increase in sub threshold leakage currents leading to increase in leakage power. With the advance of each generation of the fabrication process a five-fold increase in leakage power dissipation is present. Leakage currents flow when the circuit is idle and so power is wasted. Efficient leakage power reduction techniques have become critical for the deep submicron and nanometre circuits. In this paper, a 4-bit Johnson counter is designed using LECTOR technique and is analyzed with different types of sleep techniques.

Our study of its work practices shows that StopFake employs the online media monitoring characteristic of modern journalism, but rather than imitating new stories it applies media literacy techniques to screen out fake news and inhibit its spread. StopFake evaluates news stories for signs of falsified evidence, such as manipulated or misrepresented images and quotes, whereas traditional fact-checking sites evaluate nuanced political claims but assume the accuracy of reporting.

On-chip timing references are well-known and understood, but for imaging systems where several thousands of pixels require seamless references, area and power consumption limit the use of more traditional synthesizers, such as phase/delay-locked loops (PLLs/DLLs). Other methods, such as relative timing measurement (start/stop), require constant foreground calibration, which is not feasible for outdoor applications, where conditions of temperature, background illumination, etc. can change drastically and frequently. In this paper, a scalable reference generation and synchronization is provided, using minimum resources of area and power, while being robust to mismatches. The suitability of this approach is demonstrated through the design of an 8 × 8 time-to-digital converter (TDC) array, distributed over 1.69 mm2, fabricated using TSMC 65 nm technology (1.2 V core voltage and 4 metal layers—3 thin + 1 thick). Each TDC is based on a ring oscillator (RO) coupled to a ripple counter, occupying a very small area of 550 µm2, while consuming 500 µW of power, and has 2 µs range, 125 ps least significant bit (LSB), and 14-bit resolution. Phase and frequency locking among the ROs is achieved, while providing 18 dB phase noise improvement over an equivalent individual oscillator. The integrated root mean square (RMS) jitter is less than 9 ps, the instantaneous frequency variation is less than 0.11%, differential nonlinearity (DNL) is less than 2 LSB, and integral nonlinearity (INL) is less than 3 LSB. © 2018 by the authors.

This aspect of information seeking is important, especially for people affected by chronic pathologies and require lifelong treatment and management. These people are usually very well informed about the disease but are nonetheless vulnerable to hopes of being cured or saved, often amplified by misinformation, myths, legends, and therapies that are not always scientifically proven. Many studies suggest that some individuals prefer to rely on the Internet as their main source of information, often hindering the patient-doctor relationship. A professional approach is imperative to maintain confidentiality, honesty, and trust in the medical profession. Objective: we aimed to examine, in a medically supervised Italian web community (SMsocialnetwotk.com) dedicated to people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS), the posts shared by users and to verify the reliability of contents of posts shared by users pinpointed as Influencers through an online questionnaire. Methods: we grouped the posts published on SMsocialnetwork from April to June 2015 into those with medical content (scientifically correct or fake news), and those related to social interactions. Later, we gave a questionnaire to the community asking to identify the three users/Influencers providing the most reliable advice for everyday life with MS and the three users/Influencers providing the most useful information about MS treatments. Results: 308 posts reported scientific and relevant medical information, whereas 72 posts included pieces of fake news. 1420 posts were of general interest. Four out of the 6 Influencers had written only posts with correct medical information (3 were pwMS, 1 was a Neurologist) and never any fake news. The remaining 2 appointed Influencers (2 pwMS) had written only posts about general interests. Conclusion: the identification of fake news and their authors has shown that the latter are never appointed as Influencers. SMsocialnetwork.com acted as a “web safe environment” where the Influencers contributed by sharing only correct medical information and never fake news. We speculate that the presence of neurologists and psychologists supervising the information flow might have contributed to reduce the risk of fake news spreading and to avoid their acquisition of authoritative meaning. © 2018","Digital health; E-health; Fake news; Influencers; Multiple Sclerosis","anonymised data; Article; clinical practice; cross-sectional study; doctor patient relation; fake news; female; health practitioner; human; information dissemination; information processing; information seeking; male; mass communication; medical information; multiple sclerosis; professional secrecy; questionnaire; social interaction; social media; social network; social participation; doctor patient relation; health care personnel; human relation; Internet; Italy; multiple sclerosis; pilot study; psychology; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Internet; Interpersonal Relations; Italy; Male; Multiple Sclerosis; Physician-Patient Relations; Pilot Projects; Social Networking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051037754

Previous works often dealt with either individuals’ trust in rumors or their willingness to share. Juxtaposing both in the same study, the aim of this paper is to investigate medical professionals’ intentions to trust and share online health rumors as a function of their personal involvement, the rumor type, and the presence of counter-rumors. Personal involvement refers to individuals’ perceived relevance of a rumor. Two common types of rumors include dread and wish. Counter-rumors are messages that debunk rumors. A within-participants experiment was conducted with 60 participants, divided evenly among doctors, nurses and medical students, each of whom was exposed to eight cancer-related rumors. Rumor type and the presence of counter-rumors were induced. Personal involvement, intention to trust, and intention to share were measured using a questionnaire. Results showed that personal involvement compelled intentions to trust and share. Dread rumors triggered intentions to trust and share more than did wish rumors. The presence of counter-rumors lowered intention to trust, but not intention to share. Moreover, rumor type moderated the relation between personal involvement and intentions to trust and share. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cancer; Digital health; Information seeking; Rumor; Share; Trust","Behavioral research; Human computer interaction; Cancer; Digital healths; Information seeking; Rumor; Share; Trust; Diseases; adult; article; doctor nurse relation; female; human; human experiment; information seeking; major clinical study; male; medical student; questionnaire; trust; tumor-related gene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048540139

Methods: To determine which online forums to use, Google was searched using five common childhood ailments. Forums that appeared five or more times in the first five pages of the Google search for each question were considered. Of these forums, those that met the inclusion criteria were used. Data from a six-month time period was collected and categorized from the discussion forums to analyze the advice being provided about common childhood ailments. Evidence-based resources were used to analyze the accuracy of the advice provided. Results: Two discussion forums were chosen for analysis. Seventy-four questions from one and 131 questions from the other were health related. Data were not analyzed together. Of the health-related questions on the 2 forums, 65.5% and 51.8%, respectively, provided some type of advice. Of the advice provided, 54.1% and 47.2%, respectively, agreed with the evidence provided in evidence-based resources. A further 16.2% and 6.3% was refuted or was somewhat refuted by the evidence found in evidence-based resources. Conclusion: While roughly half of the health-related advice provided in online discussion forums aimed at parents of young children is accurate, only a small portion of the advice is incorrect; therefore, these sources are not a major concern for the spread of misinformation. © 2018, Medical Library Association.

But this information can be biased, inaccurate, and misleading. Medical professionals should be aware of what patients may be reading about their condition because concepts and beliefs can affect symptoms, limitations, and decision making. This study sought factors associated with the quality of design and content of health information Web sites about TMC arthritis. Methods: Using 3 search engines we entered “thumb arthritis” and measured the quality of design and content of 67 Web sites using the DISCERN and LIDA tools, dominant tones using the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer, and readability, and we recorded Web site characteristics. All but 1 Web site exceeded the recommended sixth-grade reading level. We created 2 backward stepwise regression models to identify independent factors associated with Web site design and content quality. Results: In multivariable analysis, the Web site not having a clear preference for treatment was independently associated with greater design and content quality measured by DISCERN. Health On the Net (HON) code certification—a code of conduct for medical Web sites—and nonprofit Web sites had higher LIDA scores. Conclusions: Online information on TMC arthrosis is difficult to read, often biased in favor of a particular treatment and influenced by profit and HONcode.

The process inconsistency leads to anomalies in the build, which hinders AM's broader adoption to critical structural component manufacturing. Therefore, it is crucial to detect any process change/anomaly in a timely and accurate manner for potential corrective operations. Real-time thermal image streams captured from AM processes are regarded as most informative signatures of the process stability. Existing state-of-the-art studies on thermal image streams focus merely on in situ sensing, feature extraction, and their relationship with process setup parameters and material properties. The objective of this paper is to develop a statistical process control (SPC) approach to detect process changes as soon as it occurs based on predefined distribution of the monitoring statistics. There are two major challenges: 1) complex spatial interdependence exists in the thermal images and current engineering knowledge is not sufficient to describe all the variability, and 2) the thermal images suffer from a large data volume, a low signal-to-noise ratio, and an ill structure with missing data. To tackle these challenges, multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA) approach is used to extract low dimensional features and residuals. Subsequently, an online dual control charting system is proposed by leveraging multivariate T 2 and Q control charts to detect changes in extracted low dimensional features and residuals, respectively. A real-world case study of thin wall fabrication using a Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS) process is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and the accuracy of process anomaly detection is validated based on X-ray computed tomography information collected from the final build offline. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Dual control chart; MPCA; Process monitoring; Tensor","3D printers; Additives; Amplitude modulation; Anomaly detection; Computerized tomography; Control charts; Feature extraction; Flowcharting; Principal component analysis; Process monitoring; Signal to noise ratio; Tensors; Thermal Engineering; Engineering knowledge; Informative signatures; Laser engineered net shaping; Low signal-to-noise ratio; MPCA; Multilinear principal component analysis (MPCA); Statistical process controls (SPC); X-ray computed tomography; Statistical process control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052889288

However, this increasing abundance of data requires supercomputers faster and more powerful than were ever built without the need to build a nuclear plant next to each one! Single flux quantum (SFQ) technology has the potential to meet those booming demands for lower power consumption and higher operation speeds in the electronics industry and future exascale supercomputing systems. Nevertheless, the promised benefits of three orders of magnitude lower power at an order of magnitude higher performance have yet to be attained. In particular, variability and scalability have been long-term obstacles for the technology to advance, compete, and replace the well-founded Silicon CMOS. Notwithstanding that SFQ fabrication has quite improved over the past two decades, its level of variability has to be taken into design consideration. Moreover, the absence of an established tools flow hinders the scalability and the automatibility, which are among the trumps of CMOS technology in digital VLSI. Specifically, as a consequence, ultra-high-speed clocking of large-scale SFQ circuits in the presence of large levels of variability represents a tough obstacle for the technology to advance. In this paper, we propose an innovative self-adaptive clocking technique, which is designed to be resilient in such uncertain environments. Whereas the traditional balanced tree zero-skew clocking is not reliable for large-scale SFQ designs, our proposed hierarchical chains of homogeneous clover-leaves clocking inherits its robustness from spatially correlated cell delays and from the timing robustness of the SFQ traditional counter-flow clocking. Our simulations on ISCAS'85 benchmark circuits show that our robust clocking costs can be on average within 34% as fast as ideal zero-skew jitter-free clock trees with an average area overhead of 58%. Moreover, lower area overhead is also possible at the cost of performance, demonstrating the possible trade-off between performance and area. We assert that these overheads are acceptable given the benefits of more reliable functionality, as quantified by yield, as well as improved scalability. In particular, previous efforts reported that a similar, but more limited, clocking structure leads to up to 93% higher yield than zero-skew clock trees. © 2018 IEEE.","Asynchronous; clock distribution networks (CDNs); RSFQ; single flux quantum (SFQ); timing","Clock distribution networks; CMOS integrated circuits; Delay circuits; Economic and social effects; Electronics industry; Forestry; Logic gates; Plants (botany); Robustness (control systems); Scalability; Supercomputers; Superconducting devices; Timing circuits; Asynchronous; Delays; Integrated circuit modeling; RSFQ; Timing; Clocks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050233275

This calls for low-volume and high-precision liquid handling solutions with ease-of-use and portability. In this article, a new digital droplet pipetting method is introduced for the first time, derived from the microfluidic impact printing principle. Configured as a conventional handheld pipette, the prototype device consists of a plug-and-play and disposable microfluidic pipetting chip, driven by a programmable electromagnetic actuator for on-demand dispensing of nanoliter droplets. In particular, the impact-driven microfluidic pipetting chip, in place of the traditional disposable pipette tips, offers both liquid loading and droplet generation. The printing nozzle has been micro-fabricated using a femtosecond laser with a super-hydrophobic structure, in order to minimize the dispensing residues. As a result of the high-precision droplet dispensing principle, the variations of the dispensed volume have been successfully reduced from 49.5% to 0.6% at 0.1 μL, as compared to its commercial counterparts. A proof-of-concept study for concentration dilution and quantitative analysis of cell drug resistance has been carried out by using the digital droplet pipetting system, demonstrating its potential in a broad range of biomedical applications which require both high precision and low-volume processing. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"buffer; doxorubicin; fluorescein sodium; analytic method; Article; biocompatibility; calibration; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; digital droplet pipetting method; dilution; drug resistance; human; human cell; hydrophobicity; low level laser therapy; measurement accuracy; microfluidics; nanofabrication; printing; priority journal; proof of concept; quantitative analysis; random error; scanning electron microscopy; surface tension; writing system; chemical phenomena; equipment design; lab on a chip; Equipment Design; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053637032

In this paper, we propose an integrated methodology for the data collection, the reconstruction, the analysis and the visualization of the development of a country’s political landscape from Twitter data. Method The proposed method relies solely on the interactions between Twitter accounts and is independent of the characteristics of the shared contents such as the language of the tweets. We validate our methodology on a case study on the 2017 French presidential election (60 million Twitter exchanges between more than 2.4 million users) via two independent methods: the comparison between our automated political categorization and a human categorization based on the evaluation of a sample of 5000 profiles descriptions; the correspondence between the reconfigurations detected in the reconstructed political landscape and key political events reported in the media. This latter validation demonstrated the ability of our approach to accurately reflect the reconfigurations at play in the off-line political scene. Results We built on this reconstruction to give insights into the opinion dynamics and the reconfigurations of political communities at play during a presidential election. First, we propose a quantitative description and analysis of the political engagement of members of political communities. Second, we analyze the impact of political communities on information diffusion and in particular on their role in the fake news phenomena. We measure a differential echo chamber effect on the different types of political news (fake news, debunks, standard news) caused by the community structure and emphasize the importance of addressing the meso-structures of political networks in understanding the fake news phenomena. Conclusions Giving access to an intermediate level, between sociological surveys in the field and large statistical studies (such as those conducted by national or international organizations) we demonstrate that social networks data make it possible to qualify and quantify the activity of political communities in a multi-polar political environment; as well as their temporal evolution and reconfiguration, their structure, their alliance strategies and their semantic particularities during a presidential campaign through the analysis of their digital traces. We conclude this paper with a comment on the political and ethical implications of the use of social networks data in politics. We stress the importance of developing social macroscopes that will enable citizens to better understand how they collectively make society and propose as example the “Politoscope”, a macroscope that delivers some of our results in an interactive way. © 2018 Gaumont et al.

Approximately 3500 infants die from SIDS and sleep-related reasons on a yearly basis. Unintentional sleep-related deaths and bed sharing, a known risk factor for SIDS, are on the rise. Furthermore, ethnic disparities exist among those most affected by SIDS. Despite public health campaigns, infant mortality persists. Given the popularity of social media, understanding social media conversations around SIDS and safe sleep may assist the medical and public health communities with information needed to spread, reinforce, or counteract false information regarding SIDS and safe sleep. Objective: The objective of our study was to investigate the social media conversation around SIDS and safe sleep to understand the possible influences and guide health promotion efforts and public health research as well as enable health professionals to engage in directed communication regarding this topic. Methods: We used textual analytics to identify topics and extract meanings contained in unstructured textual data. Twitter messages were captured during September, October, and November in 2017. Tweets and retweets were collected using NUVI software in conjunction with Twitter's search API using the keywords: “sids,” “infant death syndrome,” “sudden infant death syndrome,” and “safe sleep.” This returned a total of 41,358 messages, which were analyzed using text mining and social media monitoring software. Results: Multiple themes were identified, including recommendations for safe sleep to prevent SIDS, safe sleep devices, the potential causes of SIDS, and how breastfeeding reduces SIDS. Compared with September and November, more personal and specific stories of infant loss were demonstrated in October (Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month). The top influencers were news organizations, universities, and health-related organizations. Conclusions: We identified valuable topics discussed and shared on Twitter regarding SIDS and safe sleep. The study results highlight the contradicting information a subset of the population is exposed to regarding SIDS and the continued controversy over vaccines. In addition, this analysis emphasizes the lack of public health organizations' presence on Twitter compared with the influence of universities and news media organizations. The results also demonstrate the prevalence of safe sleep products that are embedded in safe sleep messaging. These findings can assist providers in speaking about relevant topics when engaging in conversations about the prevention of SIDS and the promotion of safe sleep. Furthermore, public health agencies and advocates should utilize social media and Twitter to better communicate accurate health information as well as continue to combat the spread of false information. © Kelly A Pretorius, Michael Mackert, Gary B Wilcox.

As vaccination coverage rates remain suboptimal in several developed countries, and outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases become more prevalent, it is important that we build on previous research by analyzing themes in online vaccination discussions, including those that individuals may see without actively searching for information on immunization. Objective: The study aimed to explore the sentiments and themes behind an unsolicited debate on immunization in order to better inform public health interventions countering antivaccination sentiment. Methods: We analyzed and quantified 117 user-driven open-ended comments on immunization posted in the Comments section of a Facebook advertisement that targeted Canadian parents for recruitment into a larger study on immunization. Then, 2 raters coded all comments using content analysis. Results: Of 117 comments, 85 were posted by unique commentators, with most being female (65/85, 77%). The largest proportion of the immunization comments were positive (51/117, 43.6%), followed by negative (41/117, 35.0%), ambiguous (20/117, 17.1%), and hesitant (5/117, 4.3%). Inaccurate knowledge (27/130, 20.8%) and misperceptions of risk (23/130, 17.7%) were most prevalent in the 130 nonpositive comments. Other claims included distrust of pharmaceutical companies or government agencies (18/130, 13.8%), distrust of the health care system or providers (15/130, 11.5%), past negative experiences with vaccination or beliefs (10/130, 7.7%), and attitudes about health and prevention (10/130, 7.7%). Almost 40% (29/74, 39%) of the positive comments communicated the risks of not vaccinating, followed by judgments on the knowledge level of nonvaccinators (13/74, 18%). A total of 10 positive comments (10/74, 14%) specifically refuted the link between autism and vaccination. Conclusions: The presence of more than 100 unsolicited user-driven comments on a platform not intended for discussion, nor providing any information on immunization, illustrates the strong sentiments associated with immunization and the arbitrariness of the online platforms used for immunization debates. Health authorities should be more proactive in finding mechanisms to refute misinformation and misperceptions that are propagating uncontested online. Online debates and communications on immunization need to be identified by continuous monitoring in order for health authorities to understand the current themes and trends, and to engage in the discussion. © Jordan Lee Tustin, Natasha Sarah Crowcroft, Dionne Gesink, Ian Johnson, Jennifer Keelan, Barbara Lachapelle.

Many research questions, such as how misinformed users judge potential rumors or how they respond to them, are crucial issues for crisis communication, but have not been extensively studied. This paper fills this gap by originally documenting and studying Twitter users’ rumor and debunking response behaviors during disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013. To this end, two rumors from each disaster and their related tweets are documented for analysis. Users who were misinformed and involved in the rumor topic by posting tweet(s), could respond to a rumor by: (1) spreading (85.86–91.40%), (2) confirmation-seeking (5.39–9.37%), or (3) doubting (0.71–8.75%). However, if the rumor-spreading users were debunked, they would respond by: (1) deleting rumor tweet(s) (2.94–10.00%), (2) clarifying rumor information with a new tweet (0–19.75%), or (3) neither deleting nor clarifying (78.13–97.06%). We conclude that Twitter users perform poorly in rumor detection and rush to spread rumors. The majority of users who spread rumors do not take further action on their Twitter accounts to fix their rumor-spreading behaviors. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Crisis information; Debunking response; Decision analysis; Rumor response; Twitter","decision making; disaster management; social media; World Wide Web",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046749306

We recently showed that most health professionals misinterpret the frequencies of listed side effects as solely caused by the drug. The present study investigated whether (1) these misinterpretations also prevail among laypeople and (2) alternative PLs reduce these misinterpretations. Methods In March 2017, 397 out of 400 laypeople approached completed an online survey. They were randomized to one of four PL formats: three alternative PLs (drug facts box with/without reading instruction, narrative format with numbers) and one standard PL. Each PL listed four side effects for a fictitious drug: two were presented as occurring more often, one as equally often, and one as less often with drug intake. The alternative formats (interventions) included information on frequencies with and without drug intake and included a statement on the causal relation. The standard PL (control) only included information on frequency ranges with drug intake. Questions were asked on general occurrence and causality of side effects. Results Participants randomized to the standard PL were unable to answer questions on causality. For side effects occurring more often (equally; less often) with drug intake, only 1.9% to 2.8% (equally: 1.9%; less often: 1.9%) provided correct responses about the causal nature of side effects, compared to 55.0% to 81.9% (equally: 23.8% to 70.5%; less often: 21.0% to 43.2%) of participants who received alternative PLs. It remains unclear whether one alternative format is superior to the others. Conclusion In conclusion, information on the frequency of side effects in current package leaflets is misleading. Comparative presentation of frequencies for side effects with and without drug intake including statements on the causal relation significantly improves understanding. © 2018 Mühlbauer et al.

A typical wireless sensing system, however, may require considerable complexity to perform the necessary analog to digital conversion and subsequent wireless transmission. Alternatively, in the case of inductive link based systems, large, manually operated impedance analyzers are required. Based on a detailed analysis of the link impedance, this paper proposes a simple method for wireless capacitive sensing through an inductive link that uses a self-oscillator and a frequency counter. The method enables changes in capacitance to be sensed and wirelessly transmitted simultaneously. In order to test the effectiveness of the method, a self-oscillating circuit was designed and fabricated in 0.18μ m CMOS, and combined with an on-chip humidity sensing capacitor. The system was tested in a humidity chamber across a range of 20-90%rh. Measured results from the system demonstrate that capacitive changes as small as 28 fF, translating to <2%rh, can be resolved, with a power consumption of 1.44 mW. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Capacitive sensing; humidity sensing; inductive link; wireless sensing","Analog to digital conversion; Capacitance; Capacitive sensors; Digital to analog conversion; Electric impedance; Humidity sensors; Inductive sensors; Monitoring; Natural frequencies; Oscillators (electronic); Sensors; Wireless telecommunication systems; Capacitive sensing; Humidity sensing; Inductive link; Wireless communications; Wireless sensing; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049838434

These molds are often produced using a dedicated foam cutter, which may be expensive and only serves a single purpose. An increasing number of radiotherapy departments, however, has a 3D printer on-site, to create a wide range of custom-made treatment auxiliaries, such as bolus and dosimetry phantoms. The 3D printer can also be used to produce patient-specific aperture cut-outs, as elaborated in this note. Open-source programming language was used to automatically generate the mold's shape in a generic digital file format readable by 3D printer software. The geometric mold model has the patient's identification number integrated and is to be mounted on a uniquely fitting, reusable positioning device, which can be 3D printed as well. This assembly likewise fits uniquely onto the applicator tray, ensuring correct and error-free alignment of the mold during casting of the aperture. For dosimetric verification, two aperture cut-outs were cast, one using a conventionally cut Styrofoam mold and one using a 3D printed mold. Using these cut-outs, the clinical plan was delivered onto a phantom, for which the transversal dose distributions were measured at 2 cm depth using radiochromic film and compared using gamma-index analysis. An agreement score of 99.9% between the measured 2D dose distributions was found in the (10%–80%) dose region, using 1% (local) dose-difference and 1.0 mm distance-to-agreement acceptance criteria. The workflow using 3D printing has been clinically implemented and is in routine use at the author's institute for all patient-specific electron beam aperture cut-outs. It allows for a standardized, cost-effective, and operator-friendly workflow without the need for dedicated equipment. In addition, it offers possibilities to increase safety and quality of the process including patient identification and methods for accurate mold alignment. © 2018 The Authors.

Medical and security applications require very high fluxes and consequently a very fast shaper in order to limit dead time losses due to pile-up. However, if the shaper is faster than the collection of the charges in the semiconductor, there is a loss of charge called ballistic deficit. Moreover, variations of the electrical field profile in the detector over time causes a change in the collection time of the charges. According to this, the response of the detector will be affected by these variations. The instability of the response is visible over time as a channel shift of the spectra, resulting in a false information of the photon energy. The aim of this work is to develop real-time digital algorithms implementable in an FPGA in order to correct these effects and to give a stable response of the detector at very high fluxes. The method has been tested with a 4×4 pixels detector (CdTe) of 3 mm thickness and 800 μm pitch which is able to measure transmitted X-ray spectra in the energy range of 20-160 kV on 256 energy bins. The detector is coupled with an innovative custom-designed digital readout electronics able to perform a fast digital signal processing for very high-fluxes measurements. The developed method was initially tested at low count rate with a 57Co and 241Am γ-ray sources. After this first validation, it was tested with an X-ray beam, with a counting rate up to ∼2ċ106 c/s. With the characterization and the validation of this innovative algorithm we prove its ability in providing a stable response of the detector over time without losing on the energy resolution (∼8% at 122 keV) and on the dead time (∼70 ns). © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab.","Digital signal processing (DSP); Solid state detectors; X-ray detectors","Cadmium telluride; Digital signal processing; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Gamma rays; II-VI semiconductors; Photons; Piles; Semiconductor detectors; Digital algorithms; Digital signal processing (DSP); Energy discriminations; Innovative algorithms; Photon counting detectors; Security application; Solid state detectors; Spectroscopic imaging; X ray detectors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053141114

We critically evaluated YouTube videos about Zika virus available during the recent Zika pandemic. Methods: Hundred-and-one videos were retrieved from YouTube (search term: zika virus). Based upon content, they were classified as: informative, misleading or personal experience videos. Quality and reliability of these videos were evaluated using standardized tools. The viewer interaction metrics (e.g. no. of views, shares, etc.), video characteristics (video length, etc.) and the sources of upload were also assessed; and their relationship with the type, quality and reliability of the videos analyzed. Results: Overall, 70.3% videos were informative, while 23.8% and 5.9% videos were misleading and related to personal experiences, respectively. Although with shorter lengths (P < 0.01) and superior quality (P < 0.01), yet informative videos were viewed (P = 0.054), liked (P < 0.01) and shared (P < 0.05) less often than their misleading counterparts. Videos from independent users were more likely to be misleading (adjusted OR = 6.48, 95% CI: 1.69–24.83), of poorer (P < 0.05) quality and reliability than government/news agency videos. Conclusion: A considerable chunk of the videos were misleading. They were more popular (than informative videos) and could potentially spread misinformation. Videos from trustworthy sources like university/health organizations were scarce. Curation/authentication of health information in online video platforms (like YouTube) is necessary.

However, downloading and analyzing raw or semi-processed microarray data from GEO is not intuitive and requires manual error-prone analysis and a bioinformatics background. This is due to a lack of standardization in array platform fabrication as well as the lack of a simple interactive tool for clustering, plotting, differential expression testing, and testing for functional enrichment. Results: We introduce the Bioinformatics Array Research Tool (BART), an R Shiny web application that automates the microarray download and analysis process across diverse microarray platforms. It provides an intuitive interface, automatically downloads and parses data from GEO, suggests groupings of samples for differential expression testing, performs batch effect correction, outputs quality control plots, converts probe IDs, generates full lists of differentially expressed genes, and performs functional enrichment analysis. We show that BART enables a more comprehensive analysis of a wider range of microarray datasets on GEO by comparing it to four leading online microarray analysis tools. Conclusions: BART allows a scientist with no bioinformatics background to extract knowledge from their own microarray data or microarray experiments available from GEO. BART is functional on more microarray experiments and provides more comprehensive analyses than extant microarray analysis tools.

In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage rumor propagation and refutation model with time effect for OSNs. The dynamical mechanism of rumor propagation and refutation with time effect is investigated deeply. Then a two-stage model and the corresponding mean-field equations in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are obtained. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to characterize the dynamics of rumor propagation and refutation in both Watts-Strogatz network and Barabási-Albert network. The results show that heterogeneous networks yield the most effective rumor and anti-rumor spreading. Besides, the sooner authority releases anti-rumor and the more attractive anti-rumor is, the less rumor influence is. What's more, these findings suggest that individuals' ability to control themselves and identify rumor accurately should be improved to reduce negative impact of rumor effectively. The results are helpful to understand better the mechanism of rumor propagation and refutation in OSNs. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","heterogeneous networks; homogeneous networks; Rumor propagation; rumor refutation; time effect",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052717551

In order to explore intervention strategies, firstly a two-layered network was generated considering real conditions, and its diffusion threshold is calculated based on previous studies. Then, after dividing intervention conditions into before and after the outbreak, intervention strategies were explored from the aspects of network topology and public management. And the results indicated that before the outbreak, the superposition of networks will add to the difficulty in intervention, while an integrated immunization strategy which takes the topology of multiplex network into consideration works well. After the outbreak, the integrated immunization strategy has a relative worse effect. But releasing correct information could receive a better effect on intervention. Besides, releasing correct information in the online network has better effect on the final results than in the offline network. Also, correct information with high acceptance rate will weaken the influence of degree on intervention, which means that nodes with high or low degree have no significant difference in intervention effect. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","False information; Intervention strategies; Numerical simulation; Public crisis; Two-layered networks","Computer simulation; Immunization; Numerical models; Topology; False information; Intervention strategy; Layered network; Multiplex networks; Network topology; Public crisis; Public management; Superposition of networks; Network layers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044330042

These beverages may be perceived as healthier options than soda. To educate consumers about beverages high in added sugar, several cities and states have proposed policies mandating health warning labels on sugar-sweetened beverages. Methods: In 2015, a total of 2,381 parents were randomized to a no label, calorie label, or warning label condition. An online survey asked about the healthfulness of different beverages, and asked parents to select a beverage for their child in a choice task. Regressions compared the warning and calorie label groups to the control group and measured mediating effects of health beliefs on beverage choice. Data were analyzed in 2016. Results: Parents viewed fruit drinks, sports drinks, and sweetened teas as healthier and less likely to cause disease than soda. Compared with no label, warning labels significantly increased parents’ risk perceptions for all beverages except soda. Warning labels significantly reduced the odds of selecting fruit drinks for the child (OR=0.42, 95% CI=0.32, 0.56), and this effect was mediated by changes in health beliefs and risk perceptions. Conclusions: Fruit drinks, sports drinks, and sweetened teas are increasingly promoted to youth.

The electro-migration of Br- ions toward the anode and their reaction with the contact have been long known to adversely influence the lifetime of TlBr devices. We report on the performance of TlBr devices with Tl contacts which minimizes the effects of polarization. Results indicate that vapor-deposited Tl contacts are highly ohmic and adhere strongly to TlBr. Long-term lifetime tests were performed under alternating bias with a 17.4- μ Hz duty cycle. Unlike devices with Pt and Au contacts, devices with Tl do not exhibit the short-term (in the order of hundreds of hours) fluctuations in the spectroscopic response. Furthermore, these devices show a stable behavior and can work under much lower electric fields.

Methods: A content analysis of Zika-related news stories on SNSs between February 2016 and January 2017 was conducted to verify accuracy (phase 1). Phase 1 was followed by an analysis of volume of shares (phase 2) and a thematic analysis of headlines (phase 3). Results: Rumors had three times more shares than verified stories. Popular rumors portray Zika as a conspiracy against the public and a low-risk issue and connect it to the use of pesticides. Discussion: This study identifies the value of integrating in-depth analysis of popular health-related rumors into the development of communication strategies.

This has led to overestimations of the size of the NPS problem, obfuscation of the common underlying causes of dependent drug use and the implementation of significant and problematic policy changes. Furthermore, a failure to see the rise in NPS as just one of a number of emerging trends in contemporary drug scenes, alongside the development of online markets or the rise in domestic drug production operations, for example, impairs our ability to understand the wider societal, cultural and theoretical underpinnings of drug use. NPS are not particularly special: treating them as such can have dangerous and far-reaching consequences. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","drug policy; drugs; Novel psychoactive substances",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037729195

Because people only interact with few other individuals, and the structure of these interactions influence spreading processes, the pairwise relationships between individuals can be usefully represented by a network. Although the underlying transmission processes are different, the network approach can be used to study the spread of pathogens in a contact network or the spread of rumours in a social network. We study simulated simple and complex epidemics on synthetic networks and on two empirical networks, a social/contact network in an Indian village and an online social network. Our goal is to learn simultaneously the spreading process parameters and the first infected node, given a fixed network structure and the observed state of nodes at several time points. Our inference scheme is based on approximate Bayesian computation, a likelihood-free inference technique. Our method is agnostic about the network topology and the spreading process. It generally performs well and, somewhat counter-intuitively, the inference problem appears to be easier on more heterogeneous network topologies, which enhances its future applicability to real-world settings where few networks have homogeneous topologies. © 2017 The Author(s).","Approximate Bayesian computation; Bayesian inference; Epidemics; Network; Spreading process","Disease control; Heterogeneous networks; Inference engines; Networks (circuits); Social networking (online); Topology; Approximate Bayesian; Bayesian inference; Epidemics; Heterogeneous network topology; Inference techniques; Influence spreading; On-line social networks; Processes on networks; Bayesian networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051514469

The proposed sensor transforms the temperature to complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) frequency and then into digital code. A CTAT voltage reference supplies a temperature-sensitive ring oscillator, which enhances temperature sensitivity and conversion rate. To reduce the supply sensitivity, an operational amplifier with a unity gain for power supply is proposed. A frequency-to-digital converter with piecewise linear fitting is used to convert the frequency into the digital code corresponding to temperature and correct nonlinearity. These additional characteristics are distinct from the conventional oscillator-based temperature sensors. The sensor is fabricated in a 180nm CMOS process and occupies a small area of 0.048mm2 excluding bondpads. After a one-point calibration, the sensor achieves an inaccuracy of ±1.5°C from -45°C to 85°C under a supply voltage of 1.4-2.4V showing a worst-case supply sensitivity of 0.5°C/V. The sensor maintains a high conversion rate of 45KS/s with a fine resolution of 0.25°C/LSB, which is suitable for SoC thermal monitoring. Under a supply voltage of 1.8V, the maximum energy consumption per conversion is only 7.8nJ at -45°C. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","frequency-to-digital converter; high speed; low energy dissipation; low supply sensitivity; Time-domain temperature sensor","Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Frequency converters; Operational amplifiers; Piecewise linear techniques; Programmable logic controllers; System-on-chip; Frequency-to-digital converters; High Speed; Low energy dissipations; Supply sensitivity; Time domain; Temperature sensors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034606981

Such content may often be misleading or be digitally manipulated. More often than not, such pieces of content reach the front pages of major news outlets, having a detrimental effect on their credibility. To avoid such effects, there is profound need for automated methods that can help debunk and verify online content in very short time. To this end, we present a comparative study of three such methods that are catered for Twitter, a major social media platform used for news sharing. Those include: a) a method that uses textual patterns to extract claims about whether a tweet is fake or real and attribution statements about the source of the content; b) a method that exploits the information that same-topic tweets should be also similar in terms of credibility; and c) a method that uses a semi-supervised learning scheme that leverages the decisions of two independent credibility classifiers. We perform a comprehensive comparative evaluation of these approaches on datasets released by the Verifying Multimedia Use (VMU) task organized in the context of the 2015 and 2016 MediaEval benchmark. In addition to comparatively evaluating the three presented methods, we devise and evaluate a combined method based on their outputs, which outperforms all three of them.

The data were collected with an online survey of the adult population living in Finland (N = 1279). We found that messages had a small but desired effect on intentions when the effect of prior beliefs was taken into account, but that that effect was strongly moderated by prior beliefs. In particular, messages changed behavioural intentions among the “meat-sceptics” (i.e., those believing relatively strongly in the negative health and climate effects of meat consumption) but not among the “meat believers” (defined symmetrically).

A wide range of behaviours constitute academic dishonesty and while a complex phenomenon to examine, existing evidence suggests that there is sufficient proliferation (both in volume and variety) of these behaviours among Australian university students to warrant concern. This proliferation presents faculty and staff with new challenges in ensuring academic integrity. Objectives: This paper reports findings of a nationwide cross-sectional survey of 361 students enrolled in an Australian nursing degree program and describes the extent of academic dishonesty among those surveyed. Design: An online survey adapted from previous work was used to collect data on academic dishonesty, professional dishonesty and social desirability bias. Analysis of this data enabled identification of the prevalence of dishonesty, relationships between individual characteristics and dishonest behaviours, associations between academic and professional dishonesty, and the impact of deterrents to such behaviour. Results: Plagiarism was the most frequently reported form of academic misconduct. Most participants indicated that threat of severe punishment and signing of verification statements would deter undesirable academic behaviour. Despite this, a relatively high proportion of students reported engaging in at least one form of academic misconduct, the likelihood of which was higher among younger age groups. Of concern was that a correlation was found between academic and professional misconduct, the most common being the recording of inaccurate or fabricated vital signs and breaching client privacy. Conclusion: In health professional education, there is a tendency to assume that the nobility of these disciplines would result in a lower incidence of cheating behaviours. The findings of this study support existing literature that refutes this assumption. This study found troubling rates of academic and professional misconduct among the surveyed population. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cheating; Education, nursing, baccalaureate; Plagiarism; Professional misconduct; Social desirability; Students, nursing","adult; article; cross-sectional study; education; female; groups by age; health practitioner; human; human experiment; incidence; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; nursing student; prevalence; privacy; professional misconduct; publishing; punishment; scientific misconduct; social desirability; vital sign; academic achievement; aged; Australia; cross-sectional study; ethics; middle aged; nursing education; nursing student; professional misconduct; psychology; questionnaire; standards; Academic Performance; Adult; Aged; Australia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Plagiarism; Professional Misconduct; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043506322

Consequently, rumour detection recognizes rumours only when they have started spreading and causing harm. We introduce a new task called “rumour prediction” that assesses the possibility of a document arriving from a social media stream becoming a rumour in the future. Note that rumour prediction differentiates itself from rumour detection through instant decision making. This allows refuting misinformation before it spreads and causes harm. Our approach to rumour prediction harnesses content based features in combination with novelty based features and pseudo feedback. Our experiments show that we are able to accurately predict, whether a document will become a rumour in the future. Additionally, we show how rumour prediction can significantly improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art Rumour detection systems. © 2018 Chinese Institute of Electronics.","Data stream; Information retrieval; K-term hashing; Pseudo feedback; Real-time rumour prediction; Social media","Data streams; Decision making; Information retrieval; Signal detection; Social networking (online); Content-based features; Detection system; Real time; Scientific community; Social media; Social media platforms; State of the art; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048948823

The paper proposes making three corrective ‘movements’ that might enrich our approaches to how databases and analytics are assembled in business settings. The first movement involves the problem of ethnographic access to data-making practices. We propose taking seriously the issue of fabricating an ethnographic encounter where the process of making digital objects is exposed. The second movement concerns the visibility and the type of politics taking place in data practices. We argue for the need to displace attention from data impacts and results to the myriad of mundane practices and devices through which these objects are assembled. The third movement we suggest requires a focus on examining error and failure as key aspects of the manufacturing of consumer databases. Each of these movements is illustrated by ethnographic vignettes from a 9-month ethnographic experiment that involved participating in the first stages of the manufacturing of an online financial retail company's consumer database. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumers; data politics; Data practices; databases; digital infrastructures; valuation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042944149

Emerging news media are also responsive to the agendas of fake news, but to a lesser degree. Fake news coverage itself is diverging and becoming more autonomous topically.

The perpetrator's goal for the behavior is to meet personal emotional needs by forcing unnecessary or misguided medical or psychological treatment. Generally, a mother is the perpetrator and her child is the victim. There is a serious lack of research into most aspects of MCA, and this study is the first to utilize the anonymity of an Internet forum to investigate victims' first-hand experiences of, and the public's opinions about, suspected and confirmed MCA. Three-hundred and fifty-six posts by 348 members were explored and coded using formal qualitative content analysis. By accessing an open-thought online forum, this paper acquired information regarding social perceptions about the nonperpetrating partners who are unaware of the maltreatment; the disturbing and counterintuitive phenomenon of MCA itself; and the resistance often faced by those who attempt to report it. © 2017 American Academy of Forensic Sciences","factitious disorder; forensic science; internet research; medical child abuse; Munchausen by proxy; nonperpetrating partners; online perceptions; qualitative research","child abuse survivor; father; human; Internet; mother; Munchausen syndrome by proxy; psychology; public opinion; social media; Adult Survivors of Child Abuse; Fathers; Humans; Internet; Mothers; Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy; Public Opinion; Social Media",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026786927

More recently, DMFBs based on a micro-electrode-dot-array (MEDA) architecture have been proposed, and droplet manipulations on MEDA biochips have also been experimentally demonstrated. In order to ensure robust fluidic operations and high confidence in the outcome of biochemical experiments, MEDA biochips must be adequately tested before they can be used for bioassay execution. This paper presents the first approach for testing of MEDA biochips that include both CMOS circuits and microfluidic components. We first present structural test techniques to evaluate the pass/fail status of each microcell (droplet actuation, droplet maintenance, and droplet sensing) and identify faulty microcells. In order to ensure correct operation of functional units, e.g., mixers and diluters, we also present functional test techniques to address fundamental MEDA operations, such as droplet dispensing, transportation, mixing, and splitting.

Recent improvements in technology using Social Media (SM) has dramatically changed the way communication happens. Success stories of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, blog sites are some examples of how different media are used by people to communicate using digital technology and social media. Access to information, including healthcare, using SM is on the rise owing to its ease and accessibility. Since people have the provision to share their views, experiences, voice opinions and share knowledge on different aspects of healthcare using social media, patients, caregivers and health professionals have started accessing health related information more frequently using SM. SM has inherent limitation to be misinterpreted, misinformed, mis-represented when not used properly. Patients are increasingly turning to internet and online sources for accessing health information. Poor quality of information, damage to professional image, breaches of patient privacy, violation of patient-healthcare professional boundaries, licensing issues and legal issues are identified as challenges to the use of SM for health information by various researchers. Due to advances in technology it has become easy to access information using SM, which could be a double edged sword. This narrative review tries to highlight advantages and loopholes in using SM for accessing healthcare information. The objective of the current study is to understand use of SM for accessing healthcare based on empirical evidence drawn from studies carried out in both developed and developing countries. Studies show that correct, timely and authentic information related to various aspects of healthcare should to be shared through SM whereas incorrect and misleading health information on SM could be harmful, if not catastrophic.

First, a substrate voltage boost technique is provided to improve the linearity and speed of sampling switch. Secondly, the proposed SAR ADC provides a comparator of noise regulation without redundant comparison cycle. The proposed comparator would be regulated in high-speed large noise state in large input differential signals. In the condition of small input differential signals, the comparator would be adjusted to low-speed small noise state. Furthermore, a high-speed low-power technique is proposed to optimize the performance of dynamic comparator. Additionally, a fast SAR logic structure is provided to increase the conversion speed of SAR ADC. To demonstrate the proposed techniques, a design example of SAR ADC is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology. The SAR ADC is able to tolerate about 1.1 LSB noise errors in post-simulation with the operation state regulated automatically. The core occupies an active area of only 0.025mm2 and consumes 1.5mW.

The misinformation generated from this topic had caused great confusion and public concern. Objective: Our goals were to analyze the trend and contents of the relevant posts during the outbreak. We also aimed to understand the characteristics of the misinformation and to provide suggestions to reduce public misconception on social media during the emerging disease outbreak. Methods: The original microblog posts were collected from China’s Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo using a combination of keywords between April 1, 2013 and June 2, 2013. We analyzed the weekly and daily trend of the relevant posts. Content analyses were applied to categorize the posts into 4 types with unified sorting criteria. The posts’ characteristics and geographic locations were also analyzed in each category. We conducted further analysis on the top 5 most popular misleading posts. Results: A total of 1680 original microblog posts on the topic were retrieved and 341 (20.30%) of these posts were categorized as misleading messages. The number of relevant posts had not increased much during the first 2 weeks but rose to a high level in the next 2 weeks after the sudden increase in number of reported cases at the beginning of week 3. The posts under “misleading messages” occurred and increased from the beginning of week 3, but their daily posting number decreased when the daily number of posts under “refuting messages” outnumbered them. The microbloggers of the misleading posts had the lowest mean rank of followers and previous posts, but their posts had a highest mean rank of posts. The proportion of “misleading messages” in places with no reported cases was significantly higher than that in the epidemic areas (23.6% vs 13.8%). The popular misleading posts appeared to be short and consisted of personal narratives, which were easily disseminated on social media. Conclusions: Our findings suggested the importance of responding to common questions and misconceptions on social media platforms from the beginning of disease outbreaks. Authorities need to release clear and reliable information related to the popular topics early on. The microbloggers posting correct information should be empowered and their posts could be promoted to clarify false information. Equal importance should be attached to clarify misinformation in both the outbreak and nonoutbreak areas. ©Bin Chen, Jian Shao, Kui Liu, Gaofeng Cai, Zhenggang Jiang, Yuru Huang, Hua Gu, Jianmin Jiang.","Avian influenza A; Disease outbreak; Infodemiology; Misinformation; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047732970

Warning labels on cigarette packs might help correct these misperceptions. Methods: We carried out an online study with 1200 smokers (18-62 years old), randomized to 3 conditions: text warning labels, pictorial warning labels, and a control group (water bottle labels). Warning labels were based on those proposed by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010. Participants in each condition saw 4 randomly selected labels and rated their expected longevity and chances of surviving to age 75 after exposure. Analyses of covariance controlled for cigarettes per day and self-rated health. Results: Compared to control, both text and pictorial warnings reduced participants’ expected longevity (text: mean = 76.8 years, pictorial: 77.3, control 79.4) and their estimated chances of living to 75 (text: 62.0%, pictorial: 63.0%, control 66.5%). The contrast between text and pictorial labels combined and control showed significantly reduced expected longevity (p = .011) and chances of living to 75 (p = .004). Differences between text and pictorial conditions were not statistically significant.

The computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) has been applied on the digital complete denture which is developed rapidly. Tooth selection and arrangement is one of the most important parts in digital complete denture. In this paper, we propose a new method of personalized teeth arrangement. Methods This paper presents a method of arranging teeth virtually for a complete denture. First, scan and extract the feature points of the 3D triangular mesh data of artificial teeth (PLY format), then establish a tooth selection system. Second, scan and mark the anatomic characteristics of the maxillary and mandibular cast surfaces, such as facial midline, the curve of the arches. With the enter information, the study calculates the common arrangement lines of artificial teeth. Third, select the preferred artificial teeth and automatically arrange them virtually in the correct position by using our own software. After that, design the gingival part of the dentures on the basic of the arranged teeth on the screen and then fabricated it by using Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) technology, Rapid Prototyping (RP) technology or 3D printer technology. Finally, select artificial teeth were embedded in wax rims. Results This system can choose artificial teeth reasonably and the teeth placement can meet the dentist's request to a certain extent, whereas all the operations are based on the medical principles. Conclusions The study performed here involves computer sciences, medicine, and dentistry, a teeth selection system was proposed and virtual teeth arrangement was described. This study has the capacity of helping operators to select teeth, which improved the accuracy of tooth arrangement, and customized complete denture. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial teeth database; Complete denture; Personalized virtual teeth arrangement; Teeth selection system","Computer aided design; Computer aided manufacturing; Dental prostheses; Patient treatment; Cad/cams; Cast surface; Computerized numerical control; Conventional treatments; Facial midlines; Personalized virtual teeth arrangement; Selection systems; Triangular meshes; Dentistry; Article; canine tooth; computer aided design; dental assistant; digital teeth selection; edentulousness; face; gingiva; incisor; mandible; maxilla; molar tooth; orthodontic procedure; premolar tooth; software; tooth; tooth size; virtual reality; virtual teeth arrangement; aged; complete denture; computer interface; database management system; female; human; male; middle aged; mouth disease; pathology; personalized medicine; three dimensional imaging; tooth prosthesis; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Computer-Aided Design; Database Management Systems; Denture, Complete; Female; Gingiva; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth, Edentulous; Precision Medicine; Tooth, Artificial; User-Computer Interface",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036656827

Aiming at measuring the spatial distribution of radiation dose for mixed neutron-gamma fields, an advanced two-dimensional (2D) THGEM-TEPC was designed and constructed at McMaster University which will enable us to overcome the operational limitation of the classical TEPCs, particularly for high-dose rate fields. Compared to the traditional TEPCs, anode wire electrodes were replaced by a THGEM layer, which not only enhances the gas multiplication gain but also offers a flexible and convenient fabrication for building 2D detectors. Method &amp; Materials: The 2D THGEM TEPC consists of an array of 3 × 3 sensitive volumes, equivalent to nine individual TEPCs, each of which has a dimension of 5 mm diameter and length. Taking the overall cost, size and flexibility into account, to process nine detector signals simultaneously, a multi-input digital pulse processing system was developed by using modern microcontrollers, each of which is coupled with a 12-bit sampling ADC. Results: Using the McMaster Tandetron 7Li(p,n) accelerator neutron source, both fundamental detector performance, as well as neutron dosimetric response of the 2D THGEM-TEPC, has been extensively investigated and compared to the data acquired by a standard spherical TEPC. It was shown that the microdosimetric response and the measured absorbed dose rate of the 2D THGEM detector developed in this study are comparable to the standard 1/2"" TEPC which is commercially available. Conclusion: This study proved that the 2D TEPC based on the THGEM technology can be effectively used in microdosimetry studies and is a promising detector for measuring the absorbed dose rate distribution over an area in mixed radiation fields. This unique small gas cavity detector opens new possibilities in applications for high-intensity mixed radiation fields as well as in nanodosimetry. © 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","2D Tissue-equivalent Proportional counter (TEPC); microdosimetry; mixed radiation fields; spatial dose distribution; Thick Gas Electron Multiplier (THGEM)","Dosimetry; Electrodes; Electron multipliers; Gases; Neutron irradiation; Neutron sources; Neutrons; Proportional counters; Tissue; Gas electron multipliers; Micro-dosimetry; Mixed radiation fields; Spatial dose; Tissue equivalent proportional counter; Two dimensional electron gas; Article; controlled study; cost; electron; gamma radiation; gas; microdosimetry; nanofabrication; radiation dose; signal processing; standard; devices; neutron; radiometry; Electrons; Neutrons; Radiometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041174361

Smoke emissions and exposure monitoring is critical for public and environmental health protection; however, ground-level measurements of smoke from wildfires and prescribed fires has proven difficult, as existing (validated) monitoring technologies are expensive, cumbersome, and generally require line power. Few ground-based measurements are made during fire events, which limits our ability to assess the environmental and human health impacts of wildland fire smoke. <br><br> The objective of this work was to develop and validate an Outdoor Aerosol Sampler (OAS) - a filter-based air sampler that has been miniaturized, solar powered, and weatherproofed. This sampler was designed to overcome several of the technical challenges of wildland fire monitoring by being relatively inexpensive and solar powered. The sampler design objectives were achieved by leveraging low-cost electronic components, open-source programming platforms, and in-house fabrication methods. A direct-reading PM2.5 sensor was selected and integrated with the OAS to provide time-resolved concentration data. Cellular communications established via short message service (SMS) technology were utilized in transmitting online sensor readings and controlling the sampling device remotely. A Monte Carlo simulation aided in the selection of battery and solar power necessary to independently power the OAS, while keeping cost and size to a minimum. <br><br> Thirteen OAS were deployed to monitor smoke concentrations downwind from a large prescribed fire. Aerosol mass concentrations were interpolated across the monitoring network to depict smoke concentration gradients in the vicinity of the fire. Strong concentration gradients were observed (spatially and temporally) and likely present due to a combination of changing fire location and intensity, topographical features (e.g., mountain ridges), and diurnal weather patterns. Gravimetric filter measurements made by the OAS (when corrected for filter collection efficiency) showed relatively good agreement with measurements from an EPA federal equivalent monitor. However, the real-time optical sensor (Sharp GP2Y1023AU0F, Sharp Electronic Co.) within the OAS suffered from temperature dependence, drift, and imprecision. © Author(s) 2018.",,"concentration (composition); design; electronic equipment; emission; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; equipment component; filter; gravimetry; health impact; methodology; monitoring system; numerical model; particulate matter; prescribed burning; public health; sampler; sampling; smoke; wildfire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042635693

Until now the performance of moldless lens fabrication process relied heavily on this step to precisely control the shape of each liquid droplet. Hence, a major hurdle in lenses fabricated from liquid droplets is the large variability of droplet shapes because they are sensitive to small amounts of interfacial forces. The shape of the final droplet critically affects the imaging performance of the lenses and cannot be reversed easily. Here, we aim to overcome this hurdle by performing in situ aberration correction using Fourier ptychography techniques. We demonstrate, for the first time, that computational optics can reverse high amounts of optical aberrations in moldless lenses and achieve high resolution imaging. In terms of imaging resolution, we successfully increased the resolving power of low powered moldless elastomer lenses by almost threefold, from a numerical aperture of 0.035 to 0.099. The computational approach directly elucidates the spatially varying wavefront aberrations from each lens using the same imaging system. This provides direct feedback of droplet lens fabrication techniques without the need for advanced wavefront correction methods. The application of computational imaging onto moldless lenses, using consumer digital imaging systems, lends itself to the global efforts in decentralising high resolution image intensive scientific tools to the wider community. © 2018 Optical Society of America.",,"Adaptive optics; Drops; Fabrication; Image resolution; Imaging systems; Lenses; Liquids; Wavefronts; Aberration correction; Computational approach; Computational imaging; Correction of aberrations; Digital imaging system; Fabrication technique; High-resolution imaging; Wavefront aberrations; Aberrations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041468661

These ongoing enhancements permit increasingly detailed comparisons between the simulation outputs and real observational data. Recent projects such as Illustris are capable of producing simulated images that are designed to be comparable to those obtained from local surveys. This paper tests the degree to which Illustris achieves this goal across a diverse population of galaxies using visual morphologies derived from Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists. Morphological classifications provided by these volunteers for simulated galaxies are compared with similar data for a compatible sample of images drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Legacy Survey. This paper investigates how simple morphological characterization by human volunteers asked to distinguish smooth from featured systems differs between simulated and real galaxy images. Significant differences are identified, which are most likely due to the limited resolution of the simulation, but which could be revealing real differences in the dynamical evolution of populations of galaxies in the real and model universes. Specifically, for stellar masses M∗ ≲ 1011M, a substantially larger proportion of Illustris galaxies that exhibit disk-like morphology or visible substructure, relative to their SDSS counterparts. Toward higher masses, the visual morphologies for simulated and observed galaxies converge and exhibit similar distributions. The stellar mass threshold indicated by this divergent behavior confirms recent works using parametric measures of morphology from Illustris simulated images. When M∗ ≳ 1011M, the Illustris data set contains substantially fewer galaxies that classifiers regard as unambiguously featured. In combination, these results suggest that comparison between the detailed properties of observed and simulated galaxies, even when limited to reasonably massive systems, may be misleading. © 2018.

Car owners sometimes publish false information to protect their privacy or interests. The spread of these false messages will contribute to potential loss as rumors. Recently, the emergence of the vehicular social network has further accelerated the spread of rumors and anti-rumors. Researchers have proposed a number of methods to reduce the loss caused by rumors. However, these methods do not account for the fact that it takes some time for users to reply to the message after receiving the rumors. Each user responds differently to rumors, but previous methods do use fixed conversion rates in different states. To overcome these difficulties, individuals are classified as susceptible, trustful, contagious, immune or recoverable (STCIR). We propose a novel STCIR model to study the dynamic propagation of rumors. Each user is assigned a time threshold attribute to indicate the time delay of the user's response. In some cases, a user may receive a rumor repeatedly in the course of the time threshold. Furthermore, we introduce vehicular nodes as authorities that produce correct information to curb rumors through user forwarding, and the anti-rumors starting from users are regarded as a rumor cascade. The experimental results reveal that vehicular nodes can reduce the scale and number of rumors. Vehicular nodes emerge early and move fast, and by moving to a greater degree, these nodes can increase the efficiency of mitigating rumors. © 2013 IEEE.","rumor propagation model; time delay; vehicular node; Vehicular social networks","Crack propagation; Mathematical models; Social networking (online); Time delay; Computational model; Delay effects; Mobile nodes; Rumor propagation; Social network services; Vehicular node; Vehicular social networks; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055044266

Gynecologic cancers have become one of the most serious threats to women's health in China. With the widespread use of social media, an increasing number of individuals have employed social media to produce, seek, and share cancer-related information. However, health information on social media is not always accurate. Health, and especially cancer-related, misinformation has been widely spread on social media, which can affect individuals' attitudinal and behavioral responses to cancer. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the nature and diffusion of gynecologic cancer-related misinformation on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. Methods: A total of 2691 tweets related to 2 gynecologic cancers-breast cancer and cervical cancer-posted on Weibo from June 2015 to June 2016 were extracted using the Python Web Crawler. Two medical school graduate students with expertise in gynecologic diseases were recruited to code the tweets to differentiate between true information and misinformation as well as to identify the types of falsehoods. The diffusion characteristics of gynecologic cancer-related misinformation were compared with those of the true information. Results: While most of the gynecologic cancer-related tweets provided medically accurate information, approximately 30% of them were found to contain misinformation. Furthermore, it was found that tweets about cancer treatment contained a higher percentage of misinformation than prevention-related tweets. Nevertheless, the prevention-related misinformation diffused significantly more broadly and deeply than true information on social media. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest the need for controlling and reducing the cancer-related misinformation on social media with the efforts from both service providers and medical professionals. More specifically, it is important to correct falsehoods related to the prevention of gynecologic cancers on social media and increase individuals' capacity to assess the veracity of Web-based information to curb the spread and thus minimize the consequences of cancer-related misinformation. © 2018 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

In fact, when an age brings to the foreground the tensions of truthfulness and falsehood, correct information and fake news, reality and fiction, genuineness and delusion, this testifies to the unpredictability and inscrutable nature of the confusion into which public communication has been entrained. The rapid development of new media and digital technologies is causing a far-reaching process of change, especially in the field of politics. In his book on “the post-truth era”, Ralph J. Keyes announced the advent of a “fib-friendly times”, in which “more lies than ever are being told” (Keyes 2004, 4). However, the considerations in this paper rest on a more cautious and critical approach. They support a viewpoint of pluriperspectivism. The new media have surely raised a challenge to contemporary communications. Political affairs are always about certain perspectives and contributions in the constant agon or contest of truth. There is no completely neutral and non-partisan claim to truth, as some philosophers and scientists aspired to represent. Because of its particular nature, the truth can be revealed only with controversy and effort, never without participation and beyond any perspectives. Nevertheless, neither does the truth decline nor do we enter an age of post-truth. Moreover, we can argue about the question which age tends more towards the lie and fake news. Politics is not in a more difficult state today than it has ever been, nor is it in a much simpler position in terms of truth. The truth remains for politics a supporting ground and a permanent benchmark for assessment. It can be discovered only in its pluri-perspective appearance. © 2018 Hratsko Filozofsko Drustvo (Croatian Philosophical Society).

Communities deal with anxiety and make sense of the unknowable by mixing apprehensions with what is already known to them. With modernity, and in line with studies on a range of social phenomena, there have been efforts to develop a science on rumour. Most of these studies deal with rumour at the propositional level, such that the rumouring or rumour-rebutting subject invariably belongs to one of the two sides of the ‘true–false’ divide. Similar categories are followed in the study of rumour in social media, where the nodes in a rumour chain are, however, less hierarchical, and where images are increasingly used for persuasion. This paper, following a value-oriented approach, argues that the science on rumour has objectivized the problem, and has suggested instrumental solutions like enhancing the digital literacy of social media users. Whereas a value position should ideally attempt to efface the dilemma of the rumouring/rumour-rebutting subject, and locate rumours within the larger socio-political and historical context of a society. © 2018, © 2018 SAGE Publications.","human agency; misinformation; Rumour; social media; value-oriented; wedge-driving",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038447844

A commonly identified motive among students who engage in NPS is to improve grades. Several research studies have observed that NPS most likely does not confer an academic advantage, and is associated with excessive drinking and other drug use. This study documents the proportion of the general college student population who believe that NPS will lead to improvements in academic performance. Methods This study gathered online survey data from a large, demographically diverse sample of college students to document the prevalence of perceived academic benefit of NPS for improving grades and to examine the association between such belief and NPS. Results Overall, 28.6% agreed or strongly agreed that NPS could help students earn higher grades, and an additional 38.0% were unsure. Students with a higher level of perceived academic benefit of NPS and more frequent patterns of drinking and marijuana use were more likely to engage in NPS, even after adjustment for a wide range of covariates. Conclusions The results underscore the need for interventions that simultaneously correct misperceptions related to academic benefit and target alcohol and marijuana use to reduce NPS. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Academic achievement; Alcohol use; Marijuana use; Motives for nonmedical use of prescription stimulants; Undergraduates","central stimulant agent; academic achievement; alcohol consumption; Article; cannabis use; college student; demography; drug misuse; female; health survey; human; logistic regression analysis; male; post hoc analysis; prevalence; academic success; adolescent; adult; amphetamine dependence; attitude to health; clinical trial; multicenter study; prescription drug misuse; psychology; statistics and numerical data; student; United States; university; young adult; Academic Success; Adolescent; Adult; Amphetamine-Related Disorders; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Prescription Drug Misuse; Students; United States; Universities; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024910692

But do we lead our readers to draw a causal conclusion unintentionally by explaining why significant correlations and relationships may exist? Here we perform a randomized controlled experiment in a massive open online course run in 2013 that teaches data analysis concepts to test the hypothesis that explaining an analysis will lead readers to interpret an inferential analysis as causal. We test this hypothesis with a single example of an observational study on the relationship between smoking and cancer. We show that adding an explanation to the description of an inferential analysis leads to a 15.2% increase in readers interpreting the analysis as causal (95% confidence interval for difference in two proportions: 12.8%–17.5%). We then replicate this finding in a second large scale massive open online course. Nearly every scientific study, regardless of the study design, includes an explanation for observed effects. Our results suggest that these explanations may be misleading to the audience of these data analyses and that qualification of explanations could be a useful avenue of exploration in future research to counteract the problem. Our results invite many opportunities for further research to broaden the scope of these findings beyond the single smoking-cancer example examined here.

Material and methods: For each of the 10 patients in need of one tooth-supported crown, five monolithic crowns were produced out of lithium disilicate reinforced glass ceramic. Four different optical impression and associated computer- aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems were used for crown fabrication (digital workflows): (1) Lava C.O.S. scanner and Lava C.O.S. and CARES CAD software, centralized CAM (group L); (2) Cadent iTero scanner, CARES CAD software and centralized CAM (group iT); (3) Cerec Bluecam, Cerec Connect CAD software, followed by laboratory-based CAM (group CiL); and (4) centralized CAM (group CiD). The conventional crown (group K) was fabricated based on a conventional silicone impression followed by a conventional wax-up and heat press technique. The examiners were blinded and evaluated the crowns clinically at the bisque-bake stage (initial try-in), and subsequently after finalization by a dental technician (final try-in). For the assessment of crown quality, modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria were used. Treatment times were recorded for clinical evaluation and adjustment. The quality ratings were analyzed descriptively. For both the continuous and ordinal outcomes, the non-parametric paired Wilcoxon test was applied, together with an appropriate Bonferroni correction to evaluate the differences between treatment groups. The results of the statistical analysis were interpreted globally at the significance level P = 0.05. Results: The clinical evaluation during the initial and final tryins demonstrated similar clinical outcome measures for crowns generated with the four digital workflows and the conventional workflow. No statistically significant differences of crown quality in any state were found between groups (P > 0.005). The total clinical treatment times measured were: 456 ± 240 s for L; 655 ± 374 s for iT; 783 ± 403 s for CiL; 556 ± 285 s for CiD; and 833 ± 451 s for K. No statistically significant differences in treatment times were found between the groups (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Within the limitations of the present study, the monolithic ceramic crowns resulting from the four different CAD/CAM systems did not differ from the conventionally produced crowns with respect to the clinical quality rating and the treatment time efficiency. © Quintessenz.Das Ziel dieser klinischen Studie bestand darin, zu testen, ob digitale Workflows für die Kronenherstellung bezüglich (1) Kronenqualität und (2) Zeiteffizienz andere klinische Ergebnisse liefern als herkömmliche Arbeitsabläufe. Material und Methoden: Für zehn Patienten, die eine zahngetragene Kronenversorgung benötigten, wurden jeweils fünf monolithische Kronen aus Lithiumdisilikat-verstärkter Glaskeramik angefertigt. Für die Kronenherstellung kamen vier unterschiedliche optische Abform- und CAD/CAM-Systeme zum Einsatz (digitale Workflows): (1) Lava-C.O.S.-Scanner mit Lava C.O.S., Cares CAD-Software, zentrale CAM-Fertigung (Guppe L), (2) Cadent-iTero-Scanner, Cares CAD-Software, zentrale CAM-Fertigung (Guppe iT), (3) Cerec Bluecam, Cerec Connect CAD-Software, CAM-Fertigung im Zahntechniklabor (Guppe CiL), und (4) Cerec Bluecam, Cerec Connect CAD-Software, zentrale CAM-Fertigung (Guppe CiD). Die konventionell gefertigte Krone (Gruppe K) wurde auf Grundlage einer klassischen Silikonabformung mittels herkömmlichem Wax-up und Heißpressen hergestellt. Die Untersucher waren bezüglich der Kronen-Gruppe verblindet und die klinische Beurteilung erfolgte nach dem Rohbrand (erste Einprobe) und nach der Fertigstellung (abschließende Einprobe) durch einen Zahntechniker. Für die Bewertung der Kronenqualität wurden die modifizierten USPHS-Kriterien zugrunde gelegt. Außerdem wurden die Behandlungszeiten für die Einprobe und klinischen Anpassungen erfasst. Die Ergebnisse der Qualitätsbewertung wurden mittels deskriptiver Statistik analysiert. Sowohl für die stetigen als auch für die diskreten Variablen wurde der nichtparametrische Wilcoxon-Test für gepaarte Stichproben mit einer geeigneten Bonferroni- Korrektur verwendet, um Unterschiede zwischen den Behandlungsgruppen zu ermitteln. Die Ergebnisse der statistischen Analyse wurden global auf einem Signifikanzniveau von 0,05 interpretiert. Ergebnisse: Die klinische Evaluation bei der ersten und der abschließenden Einprobe ergab für die vier digitalen Workflows und die klassische Herstellung vergleichbare klinische Ergebniswerte. Für keinen Zeitpunkt konnte ein statistisch signifikanter Unterschied der Kronenqualität zwischen den Gruppen gefunden werden (p > 0,005). Die insgesamt gemessene klinische Behandlungszeit betrug in Gruppe L 456 ± 240 Sekunden, in Gruppe iT 655 ± 374 Sekunden, in Gruppe CiL 783 ± 403 Sekunden in Gruppe CiD 556 ± 285 sowie in der K-Gruppe 833 ± 451 Sekunden. Statistisch signifikanten Unterschieden der Behandlungszeit zwischen den Gruppen entsprach dies nicht (p > 0,05).

The proposed ΔΣ CDC is implemented as a first-order ΔΣ modulator with switched capacitor (SC) integrator and comparator. The resolution can be reconfigured by the accumulator using the reconfigurable 12- to 16-bit up-counter. ΔΣ schemes are widely used for low-noise applications owing to the ability of the ΔΣ modulator to reduce in-band white noise through its inherent noise-shaping characteristic. Low-frequency colored noises such as flicker (1/f) noises still remain. In order to reduce the low-frequency colored noise component, a chopper stabilization technique is exploited using the SC integrator of the ΔΣ CDC. The proposed ΔΣ CDC also controls the offset calibration capacitors that adjust the DC offset. This is caused by a capacitor mismatch owing to process variation and the parasitic capacitance of the input capacitive sensor. The ΔΣ CDC is fabricated by using the standard 0.18 μm 1P6M complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process with an active area of 0.66 mm2. The total current consumption for the 16-bit ΔΣ CDC is 141 μA with a 1.8 V supply. © 2018 M Y U Scientific Publishing Division.

This kind of communication and dissemination of terrorist and criminal ideas is not only much cheaper, because it requires only an investment in a computer and access to the network, but it is anonymous, it is not spatially limited, terroristic idea and terroristic actions are performed at the same time, while the consequences can affect even more people and targets than is the case of “offline” criminality and terrorism. In recent years, the increasing problem that experts talk of in public is the “dark side of surfing the internet”, the “Dark net” or the “Deep Web”. Cyber terrorism is a modern form of terrorism, which connects the virtual space and terrorist activity, by manipulating even more efficient methods of psychological warfare. In the cyberspace you never know who could be the next victim. Based on the characteristics of cyber terrorism and cyber warfare, it is possible to reconstruct the criminological dimensions of the terrorist attacks in cyberspace. Social networks can be used by terrorists for the purpose of psychological warfare in order to spread disinformation, fear, panic, intimidating messages and threats to the public. Since there is not a unique definition of cyber terrorism, this paper presents various definitions, implying numerous characteristics of this kind of criminal activity.

The topic has also found increased attention online. But unlike scientific discourse, a majority of online discussion focuses on the so-called chemtrails conspiracy theory, the widely debunked idea that airplanes are spraying a toxic mix of chemicals through contrails, with supposed goals ranging from weather to mind control. This paper presents the results of a nationally representative 1000-subject poll part of the 36,000-subject 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), and an analysis of the universe of social media mentions of geoengineering. The former shows ~ 10% of Americans declaring the chemtrails conspiracy as ""completely"" and a further ~ 20-30% as ""somewhat"" true, with no apparent difference by party affiliation or strength of partisanship. Conspiratorial views have accounted for ~ 60% of geoengineering discourse on social media over the past decade. Of that, Twitter has accounted for >90%, compared to ~ 75% of total geoengineering mentions. Further affinity analysis reveals a broad online community of conspiracy. Anonymity of social media appears to help its spread, so does the general ease of spreading unverified or outright false information. Online behavior has important real-world reverberations, with implications for climate science communication and policy. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051729129

However, the role of the internet in IPED markets, and in particular the ways in which these substances are supplied via the surface web, has rarely been considered. This article examines the online IPED market in order to inform drug policy and to provide a nuanced understanding of retailers involved, particularly exploring the relationship between buyers and sellers. Methods This paper is based on two extensive research projects conducted in the Netherlands and Belgium. The first project focuses on muscle drugs and is based on 64 IPED dealing cases, semi-structured interviews with authorities (N = 32), and dealers (N = 15), along with an analysis of 10 steroid-selling websites. The second research project primarily focuses on weight loss drugs and sexual enhancers in the Netherlands, and relies on interviews with authorities (N = 38), suppliers (N = 30), and consumers (N = 10), analysis of 69 criminal case files, and an online analysis. Results In the literature, the illicit online sale of IPEDs is generally associated with illegal online pharmacies that try to mislead buyers. While confirmed in our research, we also illustrate that there are online suppliers who invest in customer relationships and services, and that users are aware of the illegal nature of their business. These e-vendors incorporate a ‘social supply business model’ by providing the best possible service to their customers and attempting to minimise risks in order to attract, satisfy and maintain customers. Conclusion As it is likely that users will continue to make use of the internet to order IPEDs, regardless of closing down selling websites, it is first of all important to counteract these online sources by educating all types of consumers and providing harm reduction services. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Doping; Image and performance enhancing drugs; IPED; Lifestyle drugs; Online drug markets; Online pharmacies; PIED; Sexual enhancers; Surface web and dark web; Weight-loss drugs","counterfeit drug; illicit drug; performance enhancing substance; sexual enhancer; steroid; unclassified drug; weight loss drug; antiobesity agent; performance enhancing substance; Article; Belgium; body building; consumer; electronic commerce; human; Internet; marketing; Netherlands; priority journal; qualitative research; quality control; risk management; semi structured interview; weight lifting; commercial phenomena; consumer attitude; economics; Internet; procedures; Anti-Obesity Agents; Belgium; Commerce; Consumer Behavior; Humans; Internet; Netherlands; Performance-Enhancing Substances",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030859119

Proof-of-concept demonstrations have indicated the potential of sc-SWCNTs for digital electronics, radiofrequency circuits, radiation hard memory, improved sensors, and flexible, stretchable, conformable electronics. Advances toward commercial applications bring numerous opportunities in SWCNT materials development and characterization as well as fabrication processes and printing technologies.Commercialization in electronics will require large quantities of sc-SWCNTs, and the challenge for materials science is the development of scalable synthesis, purification, and enrichment methods. While a few synthesis routes have shown promising results in making near-monochiral SWCNTs, gram quantities are available only for small-diameter sc-SWCNTs, which underperform in transistors. Most synthesis routes yield mixtures of SWCNTs, typically 30% metallic and 70% semiconducting, necessitating the extraction of sc-SWCNTs from their metallic counterparts in high purity using scalable postsynthetic methods. Numerous routes to obtain high-purity sc-SWCNTs from raw soot have been developed, including density-gradient ultracentrifugation, chromatography, aqueous two-phase extraction, and selective DNA or polymer wrapping. By these methods (termed sorting or enrichment), >99% sc-SWCNT content can be achieved. Currently, all of these approaches have drawbacks and limitations with respect to electronics applications, such as excessive dilution, expensive consumables, and high ionic impurity content. Excess amount of dispersant is a common challenge that hinders direct inclusion of sc-SWCNTs into electronic devices. At present, conjugated polymer extraction may represent the most practical route to sc-SWCNTs. By the use of polymers with a π-conjugated backbone, sc-SWCNTs with >99.9% purity can be dispersed in organic solvents via a simple sonication and centrifugation process. With 1000 times less excipient and the flexibility to accommodate a broad range of solvents via diverse polymer constructs, inks are readily deployable in solution-based fabrication processes such as aerosol spray, inkjet, and gravure. Further gains in sc-SWCNT purity, among other attributes, are possible with a better understanding of the structure-property relationships that govern conjugated polymer extraction.This Account covers three interlinked topics in SWCNT electronics: metrology, enrichment, and SWCNT transistors fabricated via solution processes. First, we describe how spectroscopic techniques such as optical absorption, fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy are applied for sc-SWCNT purity assessment. Stringent requirements for sc-SWCNTs in electronics are pushing the techniques to new levels while serving as an important driver toward the development of quantitative metrology. Next, we highlight recent progress in understanding the sc-SWCNT enrichment process using conjugated polymers, with special consideration given to the effect of doping on the mechanism. Finally, developments in sc-SWCNT-based electronics are described, with emphasis on the performance of transistors utilizing random networks of sc-SWCNTs as the semiconducting channel material. Challenges and advances associated with using polymer-based dielectrics in the unique context of sc-SWCNT transistors are presented. Such transistor packages have enabled the realization of fully printed transistors as well as transparent and even stretchable transistors as a result of the unique and excellent electrical and mechanical properties of sc-SWCNTs. © Published 2017 by the American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031690411

This work represents the first demonstration of a large-area, flexible, paper-based graphene-molybdenum disulfide (Gr/MoS2) broadband photodetector using a low-cost solution-processed hydrothermal method and enhancement in photodetection through strain modulation by assembling the device on polydimethylsiloxane. Optimization, in terms of process parameters, was carried out to obtain trilayer MoS2 over Gr-cellulose paper. Under strain, potential barrier variation and piezopotential induced in MoS2 leads to 79.41% enhancement in photodetection in the visible region. Piezopotential induced in MoS2 lowers the conduction-band energy thereby increasing the effective electric field favoring easy electron-hole separation. The advantage of vertically stacked Gr/MoS2 for the photodetector is the utilization of the entire area as a junction where effective separation of electron-hole pairs occurs. Detailed studies of the mechanism in terms of potential barrier variation in Gr/MoS2 and an energy-band diagram are presented to help understand the proposed phenomenon. The present work demonstrates the significance of few-layer MoS2 or Gr in relation to strain-modulated photosensing in comparison to their counterparts grown via chemical vapor deposition. The results provide an excellent approach for the fabrication of low-cost heterojunctions for improved optoelectronic performance, which can be further extended to similar 2D-material heterojunctions for analog, digital and optoelectronic applications. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","broadband photodetector; Gr/MoS2; hydrothermal synthesis; PDMS; solution-processed fabrication; strain modulation","Cellulose; Chemical vapor deposition; Electric fields; Electronic structure; Heterojunctions; Hydrothermal synthesis; Layered semiconductors; Modulation; Photodetectors; Photons; Pulse width modulation; Semiconductor junctions; Silicones; Sulfur compounds; Conduction band energy; Electron-hole separation; Gr/MoS2; Hydrothermal methods; Molybdenum disulfide; Optoelectronic applications; Solution-processed; Strain modulation; Molybdenum compounds; Cellulose; Electrical Papers; Molybdenum Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032694923

Based on the FGTTs and FETs, a tribotronic negated AND (NAND) gate that achieves mechanical-electrical coupled inputs, logic operations, and electrical level outputs is fabricated. By further integrating tribotronic NAND gates with traditional digital circuits, several basic units such as the tribotronic S-R trigger, D trigger, and T trigger have been demonstrated. Additionally, tribotronic sequential logic circuits such as registers and counters have also been integrated to enable external contact triggered storage and computation. In contrast to the conventional sequential logic units controlled by electrical signals, contact-triggered tribotronic sequential logic circuits are able to realize direct interaction and integration with the external environment.

The recent political election was a vivid example of how social media can be used for the rapid spread of fake news and that posts on social media are not subject to fact-checking or editorial review. The medical field is susceptible to propagation of misinformation, with poor differentiation between authenticated and erroneous information. Due to the presence of social bubbles, surgeons may not be aware of the misinformation that patients are reading, and thus, it may be difficult to counteract the false information that is seen by the general public.

This content can impact preparedness and response due to the popularity and real-time nature of social media platforms. We sought to explore how the image-sharing platform Instagram is used for information dissemination and conversation during the current Zika outbreak. Study design This was a retrospective review of publicly posted images about Zika on Instagram. Methods Using the keyword ‘#zika’ we identified 500 images posted on Instagram from May to August 2016. Images were coded by three reviewers and contextual information was collected for each image about sentiment, image type, content, audience, geography, reliability, and engagement. Results Of 500 images tagged with #zika, 342 (68%) contained content actually related to Zika. Of the 342 Zika-specific images, 299 were coded as ‘health’ and 193 were coded ‘public interest’. Some images had multiple ‘health’ and ‘public interest’ codes. Health images tagged with #zika were primarily related to transmission (43%, 129/299) and prevention (48%, 145/299). Transmission-related posts were more often mosquito-human transmission (73%, 94/129) than human–human transmission (27%, 35/129). Mosquito bite prevention posts outnumbered safe sex prevention; (84%, 122/145) and (16%, 23/145) respectively. Images with a target audience were primarily aimed at women (95%, 36/38). Many posts (60%, 61/101) included misleading, incomplete, or unclear information about the virus. Additionally, many images expressed fear and negative sentiment, (79/156, 51%). Conclusion Instagram can be used to characterize public sentiment and highlight areas of focus for public health, such as correcting misleading or incomplete information or expanding messages to reach diverse audiences. © 2017 The Royal Society for Public Health","Instagram; Public health emergency; Public sentiment; Social media; Zika","disease transmission; media role; mosquito; public health; social media; social network; Zika virus disease; Article; controlled study; fear; female; human; humor; male; medical record review; public health; public sentiment; safe sex; social media; virus transmission; Zika fever; epidemic; information dissemination; interpersonal communication; photography; procedures; public opinion; retrospective study; social media; statistics and numerical data; Zika virus; Zika Virus Infection; Zika virus; Communication; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Information Dissemination; Photography; Public Opinion; Retrospective Studies; Social Media; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027263689

Although learning this procedure is a complex task, the use of simulation-based training provides significant advantages, such as enhanced patient safety. Access to bronchoscopy simulators may be limited in low-resource settings. We have developed a low-cost 3D-printed bronchoscopy training model. Methods: A parametric airway model was obtained from an online medical model repository and fabricated using a low-cost 3D printer. The participating physicians had no prior bronchoscopy experience. Participants received a 30-minute lecture on flexible bronchoscopy and were administered a 15-item pre-test questionnaire on bronchoscopy. Afterwards, participants were instructed to perform a series of predetermined bronchoscopy tasks on the 3D printed simulator on 4 consecutive occasions. The time needed to perform the tasks and the quality of task performance (identification of bronchial anatomy, technique, dexterity, lack of trauma) were recorded. Upon completion of the simulator tests, participants were administered the 15-item questionnaire (post-test) once again. Participant satisfaction data on the perceived usefulness and accuracy of the 3D model were collected. A statistical analysis was performed using the t-test. Data are reported as mean values (± standard deviation). Results: The time needed to complete all tasks was 152.9 ± 71.5 sec on the 1st attempt vs. 98.7 ± 40.3 sec on the 4th attempt (P = 0.03). Likewise, the quality of performance score improved from 8.3 ± 6.7 to 18.2 ± 2.5 (P < 0.0001). The average number of correct answers in the questionnaire was 6.8 ± 1.9 pre-test and 13.3 ± 3.1 posttest (P < 0.0001). Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the perceived usefulness and accuracy of the model. Conclusions: We developed a 3D-printed model for bronchoscopy training. This model improved trainee performance and may represent a valid, low-cost bronchoscopy training tool.","3D printing; Education; Flexible bronchoscopy; Simulation","polylactic acid; accuracy; anatomic model; Article; bronchoscopy; bronchus; endotracheal tube; flexible bronchoscope; flexible bronchoscopy; human; main bronchus; manikin; pretest posttest design; questionnaire; satisfaction; simulation training; simulator; three dimensional printing; time; trachea; bronchoscopy; clinical competence; cost; economics; education; physician; procedures; simulation training; standards; time factor; Bronchoscopy; Clinical Competence; Costs and Cost Analysis; Educational Measurement; Humans; Models, Anatomic; Physicians; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Simulation Training; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027396668

We studied the media messages put forth by different stakeholders in two Ebola vaccine trials that became controversial in Ghana. These interactions between health authorities, political actors, and public citizens can offer key lessons for future research. Through an analysis of online media, we analyse stakeholder concerns and incentives, and the phases of the dispute, to understand how the dispute evolved to the point of the trials being suspended, and analyse what steps might have been taken to avert this outcome. Methods: A web-based system was developed to download and analyse news reports relevant to Ebola vaccine trials. This included monitoring major online newspapers in each country with planned clinical trials, including Ghana. All news articles were downloaded, selecting out those containing variants of the words ""Ebola,"" and ""vaccine,"" which were analysed thematically by a team of three coders. Two types of themes were defined: critiques of the trials and rebuttals in favour of the trials. After reconciling differences between coders' results, the data were visualised and reviewed to describe and interpret the debate. Results: A total of 27,460 articles, published between 1 May and 30 July 2015, were collected from nine different newspapers in Ghana, of which 139 articles contained the keywords and met the inclusion criteria. The final codebook included 27 themes, comprising 16 critiques and 11 rebuttals. After coding and reconciliation, the main critiques (and their associated rebuttals) were selected for in-depth analysis, including statements about the trials being secret (mentioned in 21% of articles), claims that the vaccine trials would cause an Ebola outbreak in Ghana (33%), and the alleged impropriety of the incentives offered to participants (35%). Discussion: Perceptions that the trials were ""secret"" arose from a combination of premature news reporting and the fact that the trials were prohibited from conducting any publicity before being approved at the time that the story came out, which created an impression of secrecy. Fears about Ebola being spread in Ghana appeared in two forms, the first alleging that scientists would intentionally infect Ghanaians with Ebola in order to test the vaccine, and the second suggesting that the vaccine might give trial participants Ebola as a side-effect - over the course of the debate, the latter became the more prominent of the two variants. The incentives were sometimes criticised for being coercively large, but were much more often criticised for being too small, which may have been related to a misperception that the incentives were meant as compensation for the trials' risks, which were themselves exaggerated. Conclusion: The rumours captured through this research indicate the variety of strong emotions drawn out by the trials, highlighting the importance of understanding the emotional and social context of such research. The uncertainty, fear, and distrust associated with the trials draw from the contemporary context of the Ebola outbreak, as well as longstanding historical issues in Ghana. By analysing the debate from its inception, we can see how the controversy unfolded, and identify points of concern that can inform health communication, suggesting that this tool may be valuable in future epidemics and crises. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"Ebola vaccine; clinical trial (topic); Ebola hemorrhagic fever; epidemic; fear; Ghana; human; Internet; interpersonal communication; mass medium; motivation; perception; statistics and numerical data; Clinical Trials as Topic; Communication; Disease Outbreaks; Ebola Vaccines; Epidemics; Fear; Ghana; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Internet; Mass Media; Motivation; Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026915433

Moreover, extended counting methods that make use of leftover charge (residue) on the integration capacitor help to improve the noise performance of these pixels. However, focal plane arrays with small pixel pitch are constrained in terms of pixel area, which makes it difficult to benefit from in-pixel extended counting circuitry. Thus, in this brief the authors propose a novel approach to measure the residue outside the pixel using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). A first prototype of the proposed pixel, in the form of a testbed, has been developed. It is aimed at medium-wave infrared imaging arrays that have a small pixel pitch. The prototype is composed of a pixel front end, a 12-bit successive approximation register ADC, a counter, and a comparator. The front end is a modified version of the conventional design and has been designed and fabricated in 90-nm CMOS, whereas off-the-shelf discrete components have been used to implement the ADC, comparator, and counter. A measured signal-to-noise ratio at low illumination levels is 55 dB. © 2016 IEEE.","Digital pixel; infrared focal plane array (IRFPA); pulse frequency modulation (PFM)","Analog to digital conversion; Comparator circuits; Comparators (optical); Focal plane arrays; Focusing; Frequency modulation; Infrared imaging; Modulation; Pulse time modulation; Signal to noise ratio; Superconducting materials; Thermography (imaging); Analog to digital converters; Conventional design; Counting techniques; Digital pixel; Discrete components; Handling capability; Infrared focal plane arrays; Successive approximation register adc; Pixels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029839036

In this work, we developed models for automated verification of rumors (unverified information) that propagate through Twitter. To predict the veracity of rumors, we identified salient features of rumors by examining three aspects of information spread: linguistic style used to express rumors, characteristics of people involved in propagating information, and network propagation dynamics. The predicted veracity of a time series of these features extracted from a rumor (a collection of tweets) is generated using Hidden Markov Models. The verification algorithm was trained and tested on 209 rumors representing 938,806 tweets collected from real-world events, including the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, the 2014 Ferguson unrest, and the 2014 Ebola epidemic, and many other rumors about various real-world events reported on popular websites that document public rumors. The algorithm was able to correctly predict the veracity of 75% of the rumors faster than any other public source, including journalists and law enforcement officials. The ability to track rumors and predict their outcomes may have practical applications for news consumers, financial markets, journalists, and emergency services, and more generally to help minimize the impact of false information on Twitter. © 2017 ACM","Fake news; Propagation; Rumor; Twitter; Veracity prediction","Electronic trading; Emergency services; Hidden Markov models; Markov processes; Social networking (online); Wave propagation; Automated verification; Fake news; Linguistic styles; Propagation dynamics; Rumor; Salient features; Twitter; Verification algorithms; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026522971

However, in such a disintermediated environment misinformation is pervasive and attempts to debunk are often undertaken to contrast this trend. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of debunking on Facebook through a quantitative analysis of 54 million users over a time span of five years (Jan 2010, Dec 2014). In particular, we compare how users usually consuming proven (scientific) and unsubstantiated (conspiracy-like) information on Facebook US interact with specific debunking posts. Our findings confirm the existence of echo chambers where users interact primarily with either conspiracy-like or scientific pages. However, both groups interact similarly with the information within their echo chamber. Then, we measure how users from both echo chambers interacted with 50,220 debunking posts accounting for both users consumption patterns and the sentiment expressed in their comments. Sentiment analysis reveals a dominant negativity in the comments to debunking posts. Furthermore, such posts remain mainly confined to the scientific echo chamber. Only few conspiracy users engage with corrections and their liking and commenting rates on conspiracy posts increases after the interaction. © 2017 Zollo et al.

Since the transverse mechanical scanning in the common PIE is replaced by the on/off switching of the micro-mirrors, the data acquisition time can be reduced from more than 15 minutes to less than 20 seconds for recording 12 × 10 diffraction patterns to cover the same field of 147.08 mm2. Furthermore, since the precision of DMD fabricated with the optical lithography is always higher than 10 nm (1 μm for the mechanical translation stage), the time consuming position-error-correction procedure is not required in the iterative reconstruction. These two improvements fundamentally speed up both the data acquisition and the reconstruction procedures in PIE, and relax its requirements on the stability of the imaging system, therefore remarkably improve its applicability for many practices.

These were calibrated by comparison with a reference thermometer in two different calibration media: in the air when a climatic chamber was used and in a liquid when a calibration bath was used. The main difference between the media was thermal conductivity, which was more than ten times lower in the air. To compare both methods, we calibrated two sets of air thermometers twice. The first set comprised of small temperature loggers with an internal sensor, whereas the second set was a group of temperature probes connected to the measurement unit. The temperature ranges for the loggers were from 0 ∘C to 40 ∘C and for the probes from −20 ∘C to 60 ∘C. The results showed that the measured temperature errors were smaller in the bath as well as less scattered. Furthermore, the assigned measurement uncertainty was lower, if calibration was performed in a calibration bath, mostly due to better thermal homogeneity of a liquid compared to the air in a climatic chamber. Calibration shall assure traceability of a measurement equipment in such a way that a calibration procedure simulates an actual use of equipment; otherwise, the corrections and associated measurement uncertainty could be misleading. Therefore, when air thermometers, which are designed to measure a gaseous medium, are calibrated, they should be calibrated under similar conditions as they are used. The paper presents the differences in results of calibration of air thermometers under different calibration conditions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Air thermometers; Calibration by comparison; Climatic chamber; Liquid bath","Liquids; Probes; Temperature measurement; Thermal conductivity; Thermometers; Uncertainty analysis; Units of measurement; Air temperature measurement; Calibration procedure; Climatic chamber; Liquid baths; Measured temperatures; Measurement equipment; Measurement uncertainty; Thermal homogeneity; Calibration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019140239

To address the high power consumption issue in high speed digital counters, a passing window (PW)-based hybrid counter topology is proposed. In this approach, the memory cells in the digital counters of SS-ADCs are disconnected from the global bus during non-relevant timing. To address the high column fixed pattern noise (FPN) under bright illumination conditions, a double auto-zeroing (AZ) scheme is proposed. In this technique, the AZ process is employed twice at reset and signal level, respectively. The double AZ scheme not only allows the comparator to serve as a crossing detector around the common-mode level, but it also enables low-voltage comparator design. The proposed techniques are experimentally verified in a prototype chip designed and fabricated in the TSMC 40 nm low-power CMOS process. The PW technique saves 52.8% of power consumption in the hybrid digital counters. Dark/bright column FPN of 0.0024%/0.028% is achieved employing the proposed double AZ technique for digital correlated double sampling.

However, their behavior on SNS may influence public perceptions about their professionalism. Objective This study explored how pharmacists separate professional and personal information and activities on SNS, their perceptions of professional behavior on SNS, and opinions on guidelines in this area. Methods In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with international practising pharmacists (n = 31) recruited from a range of countries (n = 9). Initially, pharmacists known to the research team were invited, and thereafter, participants were recruited using a snowballing technique. The interviews lasted from 30 to 120 min. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed. Results A majority of participants mixed professional and personal information and activities on SNS, and about one third adopted a separation strategy where professional information and activities were clearly separated from personal ones (e.g. two different SNS accounts, or one particular SNS for professional use and another platform for personal purposes). Most participants expressed concern over how pharmacists present themselves and behave in SNS when they reported (un)professional behaviors of peers they had observed. Examples of perceived unprofessional behaviors included revealing details of personal life and activities; open complaints about the pharmacy sector, co-workers, physicians, and patients; inappropriate description of pharmacists’ roles and activities; and breaches of patient confidentiality. Positive professional behaviors, such as expression of compassion for patients, examples of effective patient management, promotion of pharmacists’ role, and correction of misleading health information being spread online were also observed. There was no consensus on having professional social media guidelines. Some preferred SNS to be unregulated while most believed certain guidance was needed to maintain high professional standards in the online environment. Conclusions A definitive strategy to separate professional and personal information and activities on SNS was not adopted by most pharmacists. E-professionalism issues could negatively impact on the standing of individual practitioners and the profession. Most agreed that education about SNS use would be beneficial; however, support for guidelines or regulations for pharmacists’ use of SNS was not unanimous. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Facebook; Pharmacists; Pharmacy; Professionalism; Social media; Social networking sites","clinical article; confidentiality; consensus; controlled study; coworker; DNA transcription; education; human; medical information; occupation; participant observation; patient care; perception; pharmacist; physician; practice guideline; professionalism; semi structured interview; social media; social network; female; health personnel attitude; interpersonal communication; interview; male; perception; pharmacist; professional standard; psychology; statistics and numerical data; Attitude of Health Personnel; Communication; Female; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Perception; Pharmacists; Professional Role; Professionalism; Social Media",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978904272

This mixed methods study aims to understand patterns in seeking and sharing online health information for LBQ women attempting conception. Design researchers performed a qualitative content analysis of 400 discussions in lesbian-oriented Facebook groups, containing 1764 total instances of text. 400 discussions from heterosexual-oriented conception and parenting Facebook groups were examined for comparison purposes, though they will not be the focus of this analysis. This paper also presents descriptive statistics on posts observed. Setting posts were drawn from a representative sample of lesbian-oriented conception, pregnancy, and parenting Facebook groups. Posts examined for comparison purposes were drawn from groups that appeared to primarily serve heterosexual women. Measurements and findings many participants in lesbian-oriented Facebook groups sought and provided medical information. Their queries focused on the insemination process, and frequently related to posters’ specific situations, while heterosexual women tended to seek general advice about the conception and pregnancy process. The accuracy of the content of responses varied, and group members seemed to view the prevalence of contradictory information as positive evidence of diverse perspectives. Even when information was technically correct, posters did not always apply it properly to the question at hand. Key conclusions barriers to maternity care, or a lack of education and initiative among primary care providers, may drive lesbian, bisexual, and queer women to seek health information from peers on the Internet when trying to become pregnant. These exchanges may contribute to misinformation, which may negatively affect lesbian, bisexual, and queer women's fertility outcomes and overall health.

According to psychological research, SMR propagation can be better controlled with refutation. However, refutation must be timely, and supported with credible information. This is in line with the guideline provided in the Holy Quran, especially verse four of Surat An-Nisa, which urges people to refer to the leader or the authority to ascertain the veracity of new information concerning public security. This paper aims to review prominent prior psychology literature on rumor quelling strategies (RQS), and then maps them with solutions proposed by computer science research. We discovered that computer science studies in the related literature proposed noble solutions aligned with the ultimate goals in psychological research, including refutation. However, we suggest that these solutions be merged, and human intervention cannot be ignored, especially the verification process. Consequently, we identified six processes to be consolidated in a framework to further improve the refutation of SMRs. The six processes are: (1) filteration, (2) topic classification, (3) verifier identification, (4) notification to verifier, (5) verification, and (6) refutation. The identified steps act as the basis for subsequent research progress. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Refutation Processes; Social-Media-Rumor; Verification Processes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023754966

However, it is not clear how pharmacists use social media as part of their daily professional practice. Objective This study investigated the role social media play in pharmacy practice, particularly in patient care and how pharmacists interact online with patients and laypeople. Setting Face-to-face, telephone, or Skype interviews with practising pharmacists (n = 31) from nine countries. Method In-depth semi-structured interviews; audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed. Main outcome measure Two themes related to the use of social media for patient care: social media and pharmacy practice, and pharmacists’ online interactions with customers and the public. Results Most participants were community pharmacists. They did not provide individualized services to consumers via social media, despite most of them working in a pharmacy with a Facebook page. No participant “friended” consumers on Facebook as it was perceived to blur the boundary between professional and personal relationships. However, they occasionally provided advice and general health information on social media to friends and followers, and more commonly corrected misleading health information spread on Facebook. Short YouTube videos were used to support patient counselling in community pharmacy. Conclusions Participants recognized the potential social media has for health. However, its use to support patient care and deliver pharmacy services was very incipient. Pharmacists as medicine experts are well equipped to contribute to improvements in social media medicines-related information, learn from consumers’ online activities, and design new ways of delivering care to communities and individuals. © 2017, Springer International Publishing.","Facebook; Patient care; Pharmacists; Pharmacy; Social media; YouTube","Article; audio recording; clinical practice; face to face interview; female; health care delivery; human; interview; male; medical information; methodology; online system; patient care; pharmacist; pharmacist use; pharmacy practice; semi structured interview; social aspect; social media; telephone interview; thematic analysis; transcribed verbatim; health personnel attitude; patient care; pharmacy; procedures; professional-patient relationship; psychology; Attitude of Health Personnel; Community Pharmacy Services; Female; Humans; Male; Patient Care; Pharmacists; Professional-Patient Relations; Social Media",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015164423

The extended approach also adopts a prune strategy to filter out misleading patterns to the most by correlating the negative data items and the positive ones. Experiments had been performed to evaluate the performance of the PNFP-Growth over a public data set and a database consisting of thousands of people’s real health examination information (collected within 5 years from the date of this publication). The results indicate that (1) the PNFP-Growth can excavate more patterns than the traditional counterpart does while it is still highly efficient, and (2) the analysis upon the health examination data is informative and well complies with the clinical practices, e.g., more than 30 % people suffering from hypertension are having high systolic pressure and liver problems. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Association rules; Data mining; FP-growth; Health examination data; Health informatics; Negative association rules","Association rules; Data mining; Filtration; Information science; Association rules mining; Comprehensive analysis; FP growths; FP-growth algorithm; Health examinations; Health informatics; Negative association rules; Personal health informations; Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008210921

While health professionals publish pro-cancer-screening messages online to encourage proactive seeking for screening, anti-screening activists use the same medium to warn readers against following guidelines. Contents of pro- and anti-cancer-screening sites may contribute to readers' acceptance of one or the other position. We aimed to use a text-mining method to examine frequently appearing contents on sites for and against cancer screening. Methods: We conducted online searches in December 2016 using two major search engines in Japan (Google Japan and Yahoo! Japan). Targeted websites were classified as ""pro"", ""anti"", or ""neutral"" depending on their claims, with the author(s) classified as ""health professional"", ""mass media"", or ""layperson"". Text-mining analyses were conducted, and statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test. Results: Of the 169 websites analyzed, the top-three most frequently appearing content topics in pro sites were reducing mortality via cancer screening, benefits of early detection, and recommendations for obtaining detailed examination. The top three most frequent in anti-sites were harm from radiation exposure, non-efficacy of cancer screening, and lack of necessity of early detection. Anti-sites also frequently referred to a well-known Japanese radiologist, Makoto Kondo, who rejects the standard forms of cancer care. Conclusion: Our findings should enable authors of pro-cancer-screening sites to write to counter misleading anti-cancer-screening messages and facilitate dissemination of accurate information.","Cancer screening; Content analysis; Internet; Text mining","assertiveness; cancer screening; chi square test; content analysis; health practitioner; human; Internet; Japan; mass medium; mining; mortality; radiation exposure; radiologist; search engine; transcription initiation; transcription regulation; article; controlled study; layperson",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019567667

When that happens, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can request that companies distribute corrective advertisements to address misinformation and inaccurate claims. Previous research has demonstrated effectiveness in corrective advertising for various products. Objectives The present article builds on that work with a randomized experimental study (n = 6454) of corrective advertising investigating the extent to which visual similarity matters between violative and corrective ads and the extent to which time delay matters between violative and corrective advertisement exposure. Methods Our study sample included overweight or obese U.S. adults recruited from an existing online consumer panel representative of the U.S. adult population. We created a brand for a fictitious prescription weight-loss drug and produced corresponding direct-to-consumer (DTC) television ads. All participants viewed the same violative ad, but were randomly assigned to view corrective ads with different levels of visual similarity and exposure time delay using a 4 × 4 between-subjects factorial design. Results Results suggest corrective ad exposure can influence consumer perceptions of drug efficacy, risks, and benefits previously established by violative ads that overstated drug efficacy, broadened drug indication, and omitted important risk information. Corrective ads also can weaken consumer intentions to consider and investigate a drug. However, ad similarity does not appear to affect consumer perceptions and preferences. Although we found that the effects of violative ad exposure tend to diminish over time, the length of the delay between violative and corrective ad exposure has limited influence. An exception to this was observed with regard to recall of drug benefits and risks, where the impact of corrective ad exposure increases with greater time delay. Conclusions These results extend previous research to a new health condition and hold implications for regulatory policy. © 2016","Corrective advertising; Direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising; Misinformation; Risk communication","antiobesity agent; prescription drug; adolescent; adult; consumer health information; controlled study; direct-to-consumer advertizing; drug industry; female; food and drug administration; human; male; middle aged; randomized controlled trial; recall; risk; standards; television; time factor; United States; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anti-Obesity Agents; Consumer Health Information; Direct-to-Consumer Advertising; Drug Industry; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Recall; Middle Aged; Prescription Drugs; Risk; Television; Time Factors; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969921305

Specifically, micropillar splitting test was firstly employed to measure in-situ the localized fracture toughness. The results revealed that the carbon interphase can effectively hinder the interfacial reactions between Nextel™ 440 fiber and SiC matrix, thus remarkably weakening the composite interfacial shear strength from ∼293 MPa to ∼42 MPa, and enhance the composite fracture toughness from ∼1.8 MPa√m to ∼6.3 MPa√m, respectively.

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is increasingly used for topographic surveys due to the ability to acquire high resolution data over spatially-extensive areas. This capability is ideally suited to saltmarsh environments, which are often vast, inaccessible systems where topographic variations can be very subtle. Derivation of surface (DSMs) (ground elevation plus vegetation) versus terrain (bare ground elevation) models (DTMs) relies on the ability of the LiDAR sensor to accurately record multiple returns. In saltmarshes however, the dense stands of low (< 1 m) vegetation commonly found precludes the acquisition of more than one return, and the resulting DTM is not different to the DSM. Establishing the offset between ground and vegetation surface in order to correct the LiDAR-derived DTM can be challenging due to the spatial variability in saltmarsh habitats. Here we show the development and application of a habitat-specific correction factor (HSCF) for the Odiel Saltmarshes using a combination of habitat object-based classification (82% overall accuracy) and ground control surveys that reduces the DTM error to within that associated with the LiDAR sensor (average error 0.1 m). We also show that the true accuracy of supplied (unmodified) DTMs can be >0.5 m in saltmarshes dominated by dense vegetation such as Spartina densiflora. In particular, global projections of sea-level rise across the next 80 years (0.18–0.59 m) significantly overlaps this accuracy margin, implying that assessments and modelling of sea-level impacts in saltmarsh systems will likely be erroneous if based on Lidar-derived DTMs. Erroneous assumptions and conclusions can result if the real accuracy of DTMs (bare ground) on vegetated saltmarshes is not considered, and the consequences of the propagation of this misinformation through to management decisions should not be over-looked. © 2017, The Author(s).","DSM; DTM; Saltmarsh mapping; Vegetation; Wetland","accuracy assessment; digital terrain model; image classification; lidar; saltmarsh; terrain; topographic mapping; vegetation cover; Spartina densiflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011923825

The study looks into the back- and front-stage performances of journalistic information processing that are influenced by social time acceleration and the insistence of ‘click-bait’ news criteria. We used three different methods for teaching news reporting on three different groups of Estonian journalism students, and analyzed their performance using self-reflection in focus group interviews. Two groups of students, whose assignments were geared toward the outcome, focused more on front stage performances and underestimated back stage performances, e.g. the evaluation of sources, background information gathering, and fact checking.

The CCM-Italian Ministry of Health ESCULAPIO project attempted to identify the role of such information sources, in order to address adequate strategies to improve information on vaccines and vaccine preventable diseases. In the present study, data on 632 adults from Southern Italy regarding information sources were collected, and their perceived and actual knowledge on vaccinations were compared and analyzed in relation to socio-demographic characteristics and information sources. The main reported reference sources were general practitioners (GPs) (42.5%) and pediatricians (33.1%), followed by mass media (24.1%) and the Internet (17.6%). A total of 45.4% reported they believed to be informed (45.4%), while those estimated to be truly informed were 43.8%. However, as showed in the multivariate logistic regression, people having the perception to be correctly informed ascribed their good knowledge to their profession in the health sector (Adj OR 2.28, CI 1.09–4.77, p < 0.05) and to friends/relatives/colleagues (AdjOR 6.25, CI 2.38–16.44, p < 0.001), while the non-informed population thought the responsibility had to be attributed to mass media (AdjOR 0.45, CI 0.22–0.92, p < 0.05). Those showing the real correct information, instead, were younger (AdjOR 1.64, CI 1.04–2.59, p < 0.05), and their main reference sources were pediatricians (AdjOR 1.63, CI 1.11–2.39, p < 0.05) and scientific magazines (Adj OR 3.39, CI 1.51–7.59, p < 0.01). Only 6% knew the “VaccinarSì” portal, developed to counter the widespred antivaccine websites in Italy. The post-survey significant increase of connections to “VaccinarSi” could be ascribed to the counselling performed during questionnaire administration. Strategies to improve information about vaccination should be addressed to fortifying healthcare workers knowledge in order to make them public health opinion leaders. General population should be provided with correct indications on trustworthy websites on vaccines to contrast false information supplied by anti-vaccinists on their own websites or social networks pages and on the mass media. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","general population; health care workers; information; information source; Internet; perception; vaccination","vaccine; adult; Article; female; general practitioner; health care personnel; human; information; Internet; Italy; knowledge; male; mass medium; medical information; perception; population; questionnaire; vaccination; adolescent; aged; attitude to health; middle aged; procedures; psychology; utilization; vaccination; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Health Communication; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010635783

However, the properties of the three types of messages are relatively unknown particularly in the social media context. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to examine these three types of messages posted on social media in the wake of a rumor outbreak. Design/methodology/approach: Data included tweets posted after the outbreak of a rumor that wrongly accused the fast food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) for selling rats instead of chicken. Using a deductive approach, codes were derived via content analysis on the tweets. Volume and exposure of tweets were also examined. Findings: Counter-rumor tweets (52 percent) outnumbered rumors tweets (32 percent) and uncertainty-expressing tweets (16 percent). Emotions and personal involvement were abundant in rumor tweets. Expressions of credence and references to URLs were high in counter-rumor tweets. Social ties were found widely in uncertainty-expressing tweets. The high volume and exposure of counter-rumor tweets compared with those of either rumor tweets or uncertainty-expressing tweets highlight the potential of counter-rumors to mitigate rumors. Originality/value: This research ventures into a relatively unexplored territory by concurrently examining rumor messages, counter-rumor messages and uncertainty-expressing messages in the wake of a rumor outbreak. It reveals that counter-rumor messages have the potential to mitigate rumors on social media. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Counter-rumor; Crisis informatics; Online rumors; Rumoring phenomena; Social media; User-generated content","Animals; Social networking (online); Counter-rumor; Crisis informatics; Online rumors; Rumoring phenomena; Social media; User-generated content; Wakes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032339372

We fabricate thin and uniform electrospun polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) nanofibers with a diameter of 170 ± 80 nm, containing up to 254 ± 9 mg mL-1 of non-agglomerated UCNPs. On distributing these nanofibers in a microfluidic channel a 50-fold increase in luminescence over dispersed particles can be obtained. A versatile miniaturized platform is created to work with small sample volumes by transferring the upconversion nanofibers into microfluidic channels. Fast and reproducible analytical signal response to their environment is demonstrated by taking advantage of the isotope effect between H2O and D2O upon 980 nm excitation. Furthermore, relevance to analytical applications employing energy transfer was confirmed using the spectral overlap of the green UCNP emission with the absorption spectra of a dye. At minute optical path lengths (e.g. 50 μm) the luminescence properties of the UCNPs help in avoiding the most disturbing light scattering effects of the excitation source and channel geometries. This new nanomaterial platform enables rapid, simple and reliable online monitoring in microfluidic systems, medical applications (e.g. in-tissue, in vivo) and anti-counterfeiting in contrast to solution-based UCNP applications. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Energy transfer; Fluidic devices; Light scattering; Luminescence; Medical applications; Microfluidics; Mobile devices; Nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Online systems; Partial discharges; Analytical applications; Electrospun nanofibers; Luminescence properties; Micro fluidic system; Multifunctional composites; Optical path lengths; Polyvinyl pyrrolidone; Upconversion nanoparticles; Nanofibers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030221489

OBJECTIVE To develop a measure of parental knowledge about oSDB and AT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A sequential design was used for scale development. A prototype measure containing 9 oSDB and AT themes and 85 items was administered in survey format via an online platform. Participants included 19 clinician experts (otolaryngologists and pediatricians) and 13 laymen (parents of children who snore or do not snore, and other adults). Quantitative and qualitative responses were used to modify the measure and create the knowledge scale. Content validity of the scale was established through expert feedback and evaluation. Criterion validity was established with t test comparisons of experts with laymen. Reliability of the responses was assessed with Cronbach a testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES An 85-item prototype measure and 39-item modified measure were evaluated for consensus/approval and psychometric integrity. RESULTS Of 45 potential participants, 32 individuals (71%) responded to the prototype scale. Respondents included 19 clinician experts (59%) (otolaryngologists and pediatricians) and 13 laymen (41%) (parents of children who snore [n = 8] or do not snore [n = 2] and other adults [n = 3]); demographic data were not collected. Content analysis and qualitative feedback were largely rated positively: 27 respondents (84%) stated that the measure was a good evaluation of knowledge, 30 respondents (94%) commented that the items were clear, and 31 individuals (97%) approved of its organization, although there were several suggestions for rewording and/or addition of response options. Experts identified themes most important for assessing oSDB (symptoms) and AT (experiences: risks and benefits) knowledge. These qualitative comments were used to modify the scale, and items were eliminated if more than 2 were reported as misleading or less than 85% of clinicians provided correct responses. Five themes (oSDB symptoms, treatment options, AT risks, anesthesia, and AT benefits) and 39 items composed the final scale. Experts scored higher than laymen on the oSDB and AT Knowledge Scale for Parents overall (17 [94%] vs 12 [67%]; Cohen d = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.05-2.86) and within all themes, including experiences of children with oSDB (19 [88%] vs 13 [62%]; Cohen d = 1.53; 95% CI, 0.71-2.32), treatment options (19 [97%] vs 12 [68%]; Cohen d = 1.74; 95% CI, 0.88-2.57), AT risks (17 [97%] vs 12 [59%]; Cohen d = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.03-2.83), anesthesia (17 [97%] vs 12 [79%]; Cohen d = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.29-1.88), and AT benefits (17 [95%] vs 12 [67%]; Cohen d = 1.28; 95% CI, 0.46-2.09), demonstrating criterion validity. All responses demonstrated high reliability (Cronbach a = 0.94).

Timely access to EC pills is critical because they are more likely to work the sooner they are taken. This study assesses whether LNG EC is sold in accordance with current Food and Drug Administration regulations. Methods We distributed an online questionnaire through an EC-focused listserv for reproductive health professionals, asking data collectors to visit local stores and document product names, price, over-the-counter shelf availability, and misinformation about age restrictions. We used χ2 analysis to assess bivariate associations and t tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to determine differences in means. Results We collected information about 220 stores. The majority (65%) stocked EC on over-the-counter shelves, although only 22% of these displayed it without a locked security enclosure. Chain pharmacies were more likely to shelf-stock EC than independent pharmacies (77% vs. 5%; p = .000), but variation existed among stores within the same chain. Among stores that were asked, 40% incorrectly reported an age restriction for non-prescription purchase of LNG EC, whereas 95% correctly reported that men can buy LNG EC. The average price of branded and generic LNG EC was $49.64 and $40.05, respectively. Conclusions Changes in the regulatory status of LNG EC have resulted in widespread confusion about how EC can be sold, and its high price contributes to access barriers. Retailers should ensure that consumers can access LNG EC quickly and easily by stocking the product on over-the-counter shelves and educating staff about current regulations. © 2016 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health",,"contraceptive agent; generic drug; levonorgestrel; non prescription drug; age; Article; drug cost; drug information; drug marketing; drug storage; emergency contraception; health care access; human; nonlinear system; pharmacy; prescription; questionnaire; adolescent; adult; emergency contraception; female; health care delivery; legislation and jurisprudence; male; procedures; social control; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Contraception, Postcoital; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Levonorgestrel; Male; Nonprescription Drugs; Social Control, Formal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994403518

Fundamental to suicide prevention efforts is public awareness, which in turn, is influenced by literacy levels about men’s depression and suicide. Aim: The aim of this study is to examine sex differences in mental health literacy with respect to men’s depression and suicide among a cohort of Canadian respondents. Methods: About 901 English-speaking Canadian men and women completed online survey questionnaires to evaluate mental health literacy levels using 10-item D-Lit and 8-item LOSS questionnaires, which assess factual knowledge concerning men’s depression and suicide. Statistical tests (Chi-square, z-test) were used to identify significant differences between sex sub-groups at 95% confidence. Results: Overall, respondents correctly identified 67% of questions measuring literacy levels about male depression. Respondents’ male suicide literacy was significantly poorer at 53.7%. Misperceptions were especially evident in terms of differentiating men’s depressive symptoms from other mental illnesses, estimating prevalence and identifying factors linked to male suicide. Significant sex differences highlighted that females had higher literacy levels than men in regard to male depression. Conclusions: Implementing gender sensitive and specific programs to target and advance literacy levels about men’s depression may be key to ultimately reducing depression and suicide among men in Canada. © 2016 The Author(s).

In comparison with their micronscale counterpart, Al nanoparticles possess large specific surface area and low apparent activation energy of combustion, which reduce ignition delay significantly. In this paper, ignition and subsequently burning of consolidated Al nanoparticle pellets are performed via a continuous wave (CW) argon laser in a closed spherical chamber filled with oxygen. Pellets are fabricated using two types of nanoparticle sizes of 40–60 and 60–80 nm, respectively. A photodiode is used to measure the ignition delay, while a digital camera captures the location of the flame front. It is found that for the 40–60-nm nanoparticle pellets, ignition delay reduces with increasing the oxygen pressure or using the higher laser power. Analysis of the flame propagation rate suggests that oxygen diffusion is an important mechanism during burning of these porous nanoparticle pellets. The combustion characteristics of the Al pellets are compared to a simplified model of the diffusion-controlled oxidation mechanism. While experimental measurements of pellets of 40–60 nm Al particles agree with the computed diffusion-limiting mechanism, a shifted behavior is observed from the pellets of 60–80 nm Al particles, largely due to the inhomogeneity of their porous structures. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Aluminum nanoparticle; Combustion kinetics; Diffusion; Flame combustion model; Laser ignition","Activation energy; Aluminum; Argon lasers; Combustion; Diffusion; Nanoparticles; Oxygen; Pelletizing; Aluminum nanoparticles; Apparent activation energy; Combustion characteristics; Combustion kinetics; Flame combustion; Flame propagation rate; Large specific surface areas; Laser ignition; Ignition; aluminum nanoparticle; nanoparticle; unclassified drug; Article; chemical procedures; chemical reaction kinetics; combustion; laser ignition; molecular dynamics; molecular imaging; nanobiotechnology; oxidation; oxygen diffusion; particle size; physical chemistry; physical parameters; porosity; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994530378

We examine the accuracy and bias of perceptions among men who have tested for HIV (n = 391) and compare them to the perceptions among men who never tested (n = 432). We found that testers and non-testers did not differ in the accuracy of their perceptions, though non-testers were strongly biased towards assuming that their closest friends had not tested.

With the significant risks associated with opioids, including abuse, misuse, and addiction, any of which can result in life-threatening overdose, it is important for those seeking information from online compendia to have access to current, accurate, and complete drug information to help support clinical treatment decisions. Although compendia are informative, readily available, and user friendly, studies have shown that they may contain errors. Objective: To review and identify misinformation in drug summaries of online drug-information compendia for selected opioid analgesic products and submit content corrections to the respective editors. Methods: Between 2011 and 2013, drug summaries for Purdue's prescription opioid analgesic products from seven leading online drug-information compendia were systematically reviewed, and the requests for corrections were retrospectively categorized and classified. At least 2 months following requests, the same compendia were then reexamined to assess the degree of error resolution. Results: A total of 859 errors were identified, with the greatest percentage in Safety and Patient Education categories. Across the seven compendia, the complete or partial resolution of errors was 34 percent; therefore, nearly two thirds of the identified errors remain. Conclusion: The results of this analysis, consistent with past studies, demonstrate that online drug-information compendia may contain inaccurate information. Healthcare professionals and consumers must be informed of potential misinformation so they may consider using multiple resources to obtain accurate and current drug information, thereby helping to ensure safer use of prescription medications, such as opioids. © 2016 Journal of Opioid Management, All Rights Reserved.","Compendia errors; Drug compendia accuracy; Drug-information compendia; Electronic drug information; Product information corrections","buprenorphine; hydromorphone; morphine sulfate; opiate; oxycodone; narcotic analgesic agent; prescription drug; access to information; Article; drug abuse; drug dependence; drug information; drug misuse; drug overdose; drug safety; human; medication error; mobile application; online system; patient education; prescription; drug information; factual database; Internet; medical literature; patient education; product safety; standards; Analgesics, Opioid; Consumer Product Safety; Databases, Factual; Drug Information Services; Internet; Patient Education as Topic; Pharmacopoeias as Topic; Prescription Drugs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995751505

Here, we introduce a new technique for crooked nose deformity repair. Materials and Methods: Twenty-two patients underwent intraoperative evaluations and measurements, followed by surgery using the open rhinoplasty technique. Our method involves three major steps. First is the creation of an asymmetric medial oblique osteotomy using piezoelectric ultrasonic surgery and double lateral osteotomies, wherein the asymmetric bony ascending part of the maxillary bone at the base of the nasal vault is fractured, pushed in, and delivered to the face. Second is septoplasty with L-strut preservation. The L-strut is removed as a 1-cm block caudally from the septal stump of the keystone area. A (or double) fabricated batten cartilage graft is placed on the concave side of the deviation and sutured to cover the septal stump. The L-strut is then replaced and sutured on the batten graft, redirecting the septum toward the midline. Third is an overlapping cruroplasty on the side of the long asymmetrical lower lateral cartilage to equalize both wings and correct tip deviation. Results: Our new technique was effective for the treatment of crooked nose deformity. Conclusions: Our technique of K-stone batten plasty with delivery to the face and overlapping cruroplasty may be an effective surgical method for crooked nose deformity.

Analysis of spatially distributed particles on these devices typically requires microscopy negating the cost and size advantages of microfluidic assays. In this paper, we introduce a scalable electronic sensor technology, called microfluidic CODES, that utilizes resistive pulse sensing to orthogonally detect particles in multiple microfluidic channels from a single electrical output. Combining the techniques from telecommunications and microfluidics, we route three coplanar electrodes on a glass substrate to create multiple Coulter counters producing distinct orthogonal digital codes when they detect particles. We specifically design a digital code set using the mathematical principles of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) telecommunication networks and can decode signals from different microfluidic channels with >90% accuracy through computation even if these signals overlap. As a proof of principle, we use this technology to detect human ovarian cancer cells in four different microfluidic channels fabricated using soft lithography.

To measure the point-absorbed dose and the 2D dose distribution for the patient’s therapy plan, we fabricated a solid phantom that allowed for the insertion of an applicator for patient-specific QA and used an ion chamber and a film as measuring devices. The patient treatment plan was exported to the QA dose-calculation software, which calculated the time weight of dwell position stored in the plan DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) file to obtain an overall beam quality correction factor, and that correction was applied to the dose calculations. Experiments were conducted after importing the patient’s treatment planning source data for the fabricated phantom and inserting the applicator, ion chamber, and film into the phantom. On completion of dose delivery, the doses to the ion chamber and film were checked against the corresponding treatment plan to evaluate the dosimetric accuracy. For experimental purposes, five treatment plans were randomly selected. The beam quality correction factors for ovoid and tandem brachytherapy applicators were found to be 1.15 and 1.10 − 1.12, respectively. The beam quality correction factor in tandem fluctuated by approximately 2%, depending on the changes in the dwell position. The doses measured by using the ion chamber showed differences ranging from −2.4% to 0.6%, compared to the planned doses. As for the film, the passing rate was 90% or higher when assessed using a gamma value of the local dose difference of 3% and a distance to agreement of 3 mm. The results show that the self-fabricated phantom was suitable for QA in clinical settings. The proposed patient-specific QA for the treatment planning is expected to contribute to reduce dosimetric errors in brachytherapy and, thus, to enhancing treatment accuracy. © 2016, The Korean Physical Society.","Applicator; Brachytherapy; Patient-specific QA; Phantom",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964311344

Also, there is strong evidence that fixation of C2 anatomical pedicle has the best biomechanical profile of the entire cervical spine. However, it is often difficult and misleading, to evaluate anatomical bony and vascular anomalies using the three orthogonal planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) of CT. Objectives: The authors describe an innovative and simple technique to evaluate the feasibility of C2 pedicle for surgical screw fixation using preoperative planning with the free DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) software OsiriX ™. Materials and Methods: The authors report the applicatin of this novel technique in 5 cases (3 traumatic, 1 Os Odontoideum, and 1 complex congenital malformation) collected from our general case series of the Department in the last 5 years. Results: In this ""proof of concept"" study, the pre-operative analysis with the ""two-step"" tecnique was detrimental for choosing the surgical tecnique. Detailed post-operative analysis confirmed correct position of C2 screws without cortical breach. There were no complications or mortality reported. Conclusion: This ""two-step"" technique is an easy and reliable way to determine the feasibility of C2 pedicle for surgical fixation. The detailed tridimensional radiological preoperative evaluation of craniovertebral junction anatomy is critical to the sucess and safety of this surgeries, and can avoid, to certain degree, expensive intra-operative tridimensional imaging facilities. © 2016 Journal of Craniovertebrol Junction and Spine.","C2 pedicle; multi-planar reformatting (MPR); OsiriX ™","adult; aged; Article; atlantoaxial dislocation; C2 pedicle; cervical spine fracture; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; computer program; digital imaging and communications in medicine; feasibility study; female; human; image reconstruction; male; middle aged; neck pain; odontoid process; odontoid process fracture; pedicle screw; priority journal; quadriplegia; second cervical vertebra; spine stabilization; surgical technique; vertebra malformation; very elderly",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969668365

Microblogs – a type of social media application such as Twitter or Weibo – have served as an important platform for network governance in some local governments in China. This study makes an attempt to answer the following questions: What types of strategies should governments implement on social media platforms during public emergencies? What are the effects of these strategies? Based on the case of the Shifang Incident, which was a large-scale environmental protest that occurred in Shifang, China in 2012, we analyze all the messages posted during the incident on the officialmicroblog of the Shifang government and examine the public feedback by using an online big data analysis tool. In line with the time sequence and the extent of the conflict, we divide the Shifang Incident into three phases: the fermentation period, the confrontation period, and the digestion period. In addition, we classify government strategies on social media into five categories: introducing, appealing, explaining, rumor-refuting, and decisionmaking. The analysis results show that different government strategies are applied to different phases of the incident and that the responses of the public also vary during different periods. © Institute of Information Management, University of St. Gallen 2015.","Big data; Governance strategies; Mass incidents; Microblog; Public emergency; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978602950

Current ICT tools are immature, but a brighter future looms. We examine 7 areas of ICT in healthcare: electronic health records (EHRs), health information exchange (HIE), patient portals, telemedicine, social media, mobile devices and wearable sensors and monitors, and privacy and security. In each of these areas, we examine the current status and future promise, highlighting how each might reach its promise.Steps to better EHRs include a universal programming interface, universal patient identifiers, improved documentation and improved data analysis. HIEs require federal subsidies for sustainability and support from EHR vendors, targeting seamless sharing of EHR data. Patient portals must bring patients into the EHR with better design and training, greater provider engagement and leveraging HIEs. Telemedicine needs sustainable payment models, clear rules of engagement, quality measures and monitoring. Social media needs consensus on rules of engagement for providers, better data mining tools and approaches to counter disinformation. Mobile and wearable devices benefit from a universal programming interface, improved infrastructure, more rigorous research and integration with EHRs and HIEs. Laws for privacy and security need updating to match current technologies, and data stewards should share information on breaches and standardize best practices.ICT tools are evolving quickly in healthcare and require a rational and well-funded national agenda for development, use and assessment.

Research suggests that these resources, although informative and easily accessible, may contain misinformation, posing risk for product misuse and patient harm. Objective: Evaluate drug summaries within ODIC for accuracy and completeness and identify product-specific misinformation. Methods: Between August 2014 and January 2015, medical information (MI) specialists from 11 pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies systematically evaluated 270 drug summaries within 5 commonly used ODIC for misinformation. Using a standardized approach, errors were identified; classified as inaccurate, incomplete, or omitted; and categorized per sections of the Full Prescribing Information (FPI). On review of each drug summary, content-correction requests were proposed and supported by the respective product’s FPI. Results: Across the 270 drug summaries reviewed within the 5 compendia, the median of the total number of errors identified was 782, with the greatest number of errors occurring in the categories of Dosage and Administration, Patient Education, and Warnings and Precautions. The majority of errors were classified as incomplete, followed by inaccurate and omitted. Conclusion: This analysis demonstrates that ODIC may contain misinformation. HCPs and consumers should be aware of the potential for misinformation and consider more than 1 drug information resource, including the FPI and Medication Guide as well as pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies’ MI departments, to obtain unbiased, accurate, and complete product-specific drug information to help support the safe and effective use of prescription drug products. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","drug information; drug safety; electronic information; internet; medication safety","accuracy; Article; drug industry; drug information; information system; Internet; medication error; online drug information compendia; patient safety; priority journal; drug industry; factual database; human; Internet; medical literature; prescription drug; Databases, Factual; Drug Industry; Humans; Internet; Pharmacopoeias as Topic; Prescription Drugs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963854363

They are most suitable in dusty, smoky, dirty industrial environments where most other sensors would fail. This paper presents a design method and fabrication of a low cost eddy current sensor used in real time servo-control feed-back in Active magnetic Bearing. Method/Statistical Analysis: The primary functional piece of the eddy-current sensor is the sensing coil. This is a coil of wire near the end of the sensor probe. This piece of coil forms a part of an oscillator circuit there by carrying an alternating current through it which creates an alternating magnetic field. This field creates an eddy-current to flow on the target material whose distance is to be measured. This variation in field is used to sense the distance to the target. The coil is encapsulated in plastic and epoxy and housed in threaded stainless steel housing. Findings: The designed sensor has a measuring range of 0-3 mm and displacement resolution of 7 microns at a speed of 20 kHz sampling rate. This sensor was designed for the purpose of servo control feed-back in Active Magnetic Bearing System for position control. In this feedback control system we have employed a novel method of using time to digital conversion which converts the time period of the eddy current sensor's square wave signal into digital counts using the 32bit timer counter of the enhanced capture module available in Texas Instruments C2000 controller. The digital counts give us the direct displacement value that can be used as feedback to generate the required error signal in the PID control loop. Application: The output frequency of the sensor is in the range of 700 kHz. We scale down this signal to 20 KHz by using the built-in divide by counter in the C2000 controller before feeding it to the capture module to capture the time period in a 32bit timer counter. This method of time period to digital count converter or displacement measurement helps reduce noise and errors in signal processing usually associated with ADC chips which converts analog voltage signal to digital counts.","Active magnetic bearings; Eddy current; Position control; Servo control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996921124

A two-stage track-and-hold (T/H) structure enables high input bandwidth and low power consumption at the same time. A sampling clock duty cycle control technique, which allocates more tracking time to the bandwidth-limited second T/H stage, facilitates high sampling rates. A digital offset correction scheme compensates both random and systematic offsets due to process variation and T/H amplifier gain nonlinearity, simultaneously. Two test-chip prototypes were fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process. Experimental results of a standalone ADC chip demonstrate 3.8 effective number of bits (ENOB) at 7.5 GS/s. The figure-of-merit (FOM) of the standalone ADC is 0.49 pJ/conversion-step. The second test chip combines two ADCs together in order to demonstrate a time-interleaved ADC (TI-ADC) for use in high-speed backplane receivers.

In this study, a comparison of SAW- and QCM-based sensors is performed for the detection of low concentrations of Hg0 vapor (ranging from 24 to 365 ppb<inf>v</inf>). Experimental measurements and finite element method (FEM) simulations allow the comparison of these sensors with regard to their sensitivity, sorption and desorption characteristics, and response time following Hg0 vapor exposure at various operating temperatures ranging from 35 to 75 °C. Both of the sensors were fabricated on quartz substrates (ST and AT cut quartz for SAW and QCM devices, respectively) and employed thin gold (Au) layers as the electrodes. The SAW-based sensor exhibited up to ∼111 and ∼39 times higher response magnitudes than did the QCM-based sensor at 35 and 55 °C, respectively, when exposed to Hg0 vapor concentrations ranging from 24 to 365 ppb<inf>v</inf>. The Hg0 sorption and desorption calibration curves of both sensors were found to fit well with the Langmuir extension isotherm at different operating temperatures. Furthermore, the Hg0 sorption and desorption rate demonstrated by the SAW-based sensor was found to decrease as the operating temperature increased, while the opposite trend was observed for the QCM-based sensor. However, the SAW-based sensor reached the maximum Hg0 sorption rate faster than the QCM-based sensor regardless of operating temperature, whereas both sensors showed similar response times (t<inf>90</inf>) at various temperatures. Additionally, the sorption rate data was utilized in this study in order to obtain a faster response time from the sensor upon exposure to Hg0 vapor. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the developed sensors' selectivity showed that the SAW-based sensor had a higher overall selectivity (90%) than did the QCM counterpart (84%) while Hg0 vapor was measured in the presence of ammonia (NH<inf>3</inf>), humidity, and a number of volatile organic compounds at the chosen operating temperature of 55 °C. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Acoustic surface wave devices; Acoustic transducers; Acoustic waves; Desorption; Effluents; Finite element method; Gold; Mercury (metal); Quartz; Sorption; Temperature; Volatile organic compounds; Comparative analysis; Finite element method simulation; Microelectromechanical sensors; Operating temperature; Response magnitude; Sorption and desorptions; Surface acoustic waves; Vapor concentrations; Quartz crystal microbalances; gold; mercury; adsorption; chemistry; comparative study; microelectromechanical system; particle size; quartz crystal microbalance; sound; surface property; Adsorption; Gold; Mercury; Micro-Electrical-Mechanical Systems; Particle Size; Quartz Crystal Microbalance Techniques; Sound; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938633640

In micro-fluidic applications dealing with soft biological fluids very often, digital micro-valves [also known as Quake valves (Unger et al. in Science 288:113, 2000)] are deployed to start/stop flows in pressurized micro-channels. These valves are designed in a manner so that the actuation is performed by a control micro-channel filled with compressed air seating on the top of another micro-channel filled with fluidic sample. The response time of these valves is so miniscule that they almost close immediately qualifying them to be digital in nature. Still in applications like drug screening where a small amount of intermixing may have a counterintuitive effect on the whole experiment, the valves may underperform. In order to address the problem of leakages/leaching of fluids across a fully pressure-closed digital micro-valve, we have tried to incorporate a design modification with a completely different fabrication process, wherein the closing approach of a Quake valve has been varied from top down to radially inwards across the whole cross-section of the micro-channel. The design of this valve enables its wide applicability to embedded micro-fluidics, which is widely used to mimic/study the flow of body fluids across our vasculature or is highly useful for chip cooling applications. Micro-valving has been seldom explored in the embedded domain, and the current architecture of the micro-valve in a way fills this technology gap. In our design, two concentric hollow tracks, one straight and another helical are replicated in polydimethyl siloxane using preformed 80-micron copper wires that are of circular cross-section. Compressed oxygen is passed through the helical channel to control the fluid flow in the concentrically placed straight micro-channel. The micro-valve controls the fluid flow by applying uniform pressure homogeneously on micro-channel wall so that the wall can collapse and close the channel cross-section (stop condition). The system has been designed and simulated using COMSOL multi-physics platform where a design optimization was carried out in details in an earlier work (Singh et al. in Microsyst Technol. doi:10.1007/s00542-013-1738-7, 2013). In this work, we have evaluated the design experimentally through monitoring the inlet/outlet flow rate in the central micro-channel through microparticle image velocimetry (micro-PIV) analysis on opened/closed valve conditions. A flow behavior of the central micro-channel is simulated using COMSOL multi-physics platform, and the pre/post-valving discharge have been estimated theoretically for various input flow rate conditions at a corresponding air pressure of 5 psi in the helical track. We have further validated this through micro-PIV experiments wherein the valving behavior observed is different to the extent of the transient flow part but quite similar as regards the steady-state part. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","COMSOL; Micro-valve; Microparticle image velocimetry (micro-PIV); Polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS); Soft lithography","Atmospheric pressure; Body fluids; Compressed air; Design; Earthquakes; Electroosmosis; Flow of fluids; Flow rate; Fluid dynamics; Fluidics; Inlet flow; Valves (mechanical); Velocimeters; Velocity measurement; Wire; Channel cross section; Circular cross-sections; COMSOL; Micro fluidic applications; Micro particle image velocimetry; Micro PIV; Micro valves; Soft lithography; Solenoid valves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930867063

Tomographic reconstruction is achieved using digital images from the densely-packed large-format (80×64) focal plane array sensor located behind a hyper-hemispherical silicon lens. Each pixel of the sensor array consists of an 85 μm × 92 μm lithographically fabricated wideband dual-slot antenna, monolithically integrated with an ultra-fast diode tuned to operate in the 0.6-1.2 THz regime.

Moreover, detecting signal ratios using a fully differential circuit optimally suits the intrinsic nature of very large scale integrated design. A scalable and compact hardware implementation is proposed as a proof-of-concept toward relative image acquisition. The proposed photo-current-ratio-detecting pixels completely bypass the need of conventional photo-current integration which enables high frame-rate operation of up to 24 000 frames/s.

We included articles from sources that predominantly concerned our topic of interest and that generated reader comments. Two researchers coded the unedited comments using thematic analysis, categorizing codes to allow themes to emerge. In addition to themes, the comments were categorized by: 1) sentiment towards influenza vaccines; 2) support for mandatory vaccination policies; 3) citing of reference materials or statistics; 4) self-identified health-care worker status; and 5) sharing of a personal story. Results 1163 comments made by 648 commenters responding to 36 articles were analyzed. Popular themes included concerns about freedom of choice, vaccine effectiveness, patient safety, and distrust in government, public health, and the pharmaceutical industry. Almost half (48%) of commenters expressed a negative sentiment toward the influenza vaccine, 28% were positive, 20% were neutral, and 4% expressed mixed sentiment. Of those who commented on the policy, 75% did not support the condition to work policy, while 25% were in favour. Of the commenters, 11% self-identified as healthcare workers, 13% shared personal stories, and 18% cited a reference or statistic. Interpretation The perception of the influenza vaccine in the comment sections of online news sites is fairly poor. Public health agencies should consider including online forums, comment sections, and social media sites as part of their communication channels to correct misinformation regarding the benefits of HCWinfluenza immunization and the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Disadvantages are increased fears and possible misinformation and misdiagnosis and inappropriate self-treatment. There is also loss of placebo-style trust in, and concordance with, professionals, who may experience reduced confidence, authority and effectiveness.

On the flip side, it has resulted in various forms of security vulnerabilities in the supply chain that involves designers, fabs, test facilities, and distributors until the end-product reaches customers. One of the biggest threats to semiconductor industry today is the entry of aged, reject, or cloned parts, that is, counterfeit chips, into the supply chain, leading to annual revenue losses in the order of billions of dollars. While traceability of chips between trusted parties can help monitor the supply chain at various points in the flow, existing solutions are in the form of integrating costly hardware units on chip, or utilizing easy-to-circumvent inspection-based detection techniques. In this article, we propose a technique for adaptive unique ID generation that leverages process variations, enabling chip traceability. The proposed method stimulates digital chips with an analog signal from the supply lines, which serve as primary inputs to each gate in the signal path. Using a sinusoidal signal that exercises the transistors as gain components, we create a chip-specific response that can be post-processed into a digital ID. The proposed technique enables quick and cost-effective authenticity validation that requires no on-chip hardware support. Our simulation and experimentation on actual chips show that the proposed technique is capable of generating unique IDs even in the presence of environmental noise. © 2015 ACM.","Counterfeiting; Hardware security; ID generation","Cloning; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Hardware; Hardware security; Semiconductor device manufacture; Supply chains; Counterfeiting; Detection techniques; Environmental noise; ID generation; Manufacturing flow; Security vulnerabilities; Semiconductor industry; Sinusoidal signals; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934753761

These consumer electronics are frequently upgraded or discarded, leading to serious environmental contamination. Thus, electronic systems consisting of renewable and biodegradable materials and minimal amount of potentially toxic materials are desirable. Here we report high-performance flexible microwave and digital electronics that consume the smallest amount of potentially toxic materials on biobased, biodegradable and flexible cellulose nanofibril papers. Furthermore, we demonstrate gallium arsenide microwave devices, the consumer wireless workhorse, in a transferrable thin-film form. Successful fabrication of key electrical components on the flexible cellulose nanofibril paper with comparable performance to their rigid counterparts and clear demonstration of fungal biodegradation of the cellulose-nanofibril-based electronics suggest that it is feasible to fabricate high-performance flexible electronics using ecofriendly materials. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Non-linear input referred DC offset voltage of a comparator used in an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is considered as the most important factor that degrades performance, especially for ADC architectures that utilize multiple comparators, such as flash ADCs. This paper discusses the causes of various types of offsets as well as techniques for cancelling them in dynamic latched comparators. Both background and foreground offset calibration techniques used in dynamic comparators are explained. Three popular circuit implementation approaches for foreground calibration are reviewed. A novel coarse–fine calibration (CFC) technique is introduced presenting concept of operation and its effectiveness over other available analog foreground offset calibration techniques. Simulation and measurement results of dynamic comparators that were fabricated in 2P3M, 3.3 V, 0.35 μm CMOS process are presented. It was shown that the proposed CFC technique achieves better performance than other digitally-assisted analog calibration techniques without requiring high-resolution (>8-bit) trimming digital-to-analog converters while providing compact, high-speed, low-power, and linear offset correction over the full offset range of up to ±100 mV. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Analog–digital converter; Coarse–fine calibration; Comparator offset; Comparator precision; Offset correction; Offset correction techniques; Offset trimming","Analog to digital conversion; Calibration; CMOS integrated circuits; Digital to analog conversion; Frequency converters; Trimming; Analog to digital converters; Circuit implementation; Digital converters; Digitally-assisted analogs; Foreground calibrations; Offset corrections; Offset trimmings; Simulations and measurements; Comparators (optical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937758637

This study aimed to investigate the use, relevance and challenges of Wikipedia among medical students. Methods: An online questionnaire was made accessible to students at five medical universities in Germany, Austria, and Norway. Besides demographical data, the questions covered the role of Wikipedia in the academic life of medical students. The questionnaire investigated if the students had ever found erroneous medical entries and whether they corrected these. Results: A frequent use of Wikipedia in general is statistically significant correlated with a frequent use in medical studies (p < 0.001). Information retrieved from Wikipedia is predominantly critically appraised either by comparing it to profound knowledge (79%) and/or to specific literature (75%). Despite most (97%) respondents disclosed that they already had found false information in Wikipedia, recognized errors were seldomly corrected (~20%). Conclusions: The information retrieved from Wikipedia is critically appraised. However, we found shortcomings in handling erroneous entries. We argue for professional responsibility among medical students in dealing with this dynamic resource. Moreover, we encourage medical schools to supplement information to Wikipedia to further benefit from the vast possibilities of this platform. © 2015 Herbert et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Evaluation of information; Medical education; Professional responsibility; Wikipedia","adult; Austria; book; clinical trial; education; female; Germany; human; information dissemination; Internet; male; medical education; medical information system; medical school; medical student; multicenter study; Norway; organization and management; procedures; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; utilization; young adult; Adult; Austria; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Encyclopedias as Topic; Female; Germany; Health Information Exchange; Humans; Information Dissemination; Internet; Male; Norway; Schools, Medical; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926306284

By injecting input data edges into the oscillator embedded in a classical Type-II digital clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit, the proposed receiver achieves instantaneous phase-locking and input jitter filtering simultaneously. In other words, the proposed CDR combines the advantages of conventional feed-forward and feedback architectures to achieve energy-proportional operation. By controlling the number of data edges injected into the oscillator, both the jitter transfer bandwidth and the jitter tolerance corner are accurately controlled. The feedback loop also corrects for any frequency error and helps improve CDR's immunity to oscillator frequency drift during the power-on and -off states. This also improves CDR's tolerance to consecutive identical digits present in the input data. Fabricated in a 90 nm CMOS process, the prototype receiver instantaneously locks onto the very first data edge and consumes 6.1 mW at 2.2 Gb/s.

One example is a monocentric lens, which forms a wide field-of-view high-resolution spherical image with a radius equal to the focal length. Optical fiber bundles have been used to couple between this focal surface and planar image sensors. However, such fiber-coupled imaging systems suffer from artifacts due to image sampling and incoherent light transfer by the fiber bundle as well as resampling by the focal plane, resulting in a fixed obscuration pattern. Here, we describe digital image processing techniques to improve image quality in a compact 126° field-of-view, 30 megapixel panoramic imager, where a 12 mm focal length F/1.35 lens made of concentric glass surfaces forms a spherical image surface, which is fiber-coupled to six discrete CMOS focal planes.We characterize the locally space-variant system impulse response at various stages: monocentric lens image formation onto the 2.5 μm pitch fiber bundle, image transfer by the fiber bundle, and sensing by a 1.75 μm pitch backside illuminated color focal plane. We demonstrate methods to mitigate moiré artifacts and local obscuration, correct for sphere to plane mapping distortion and vignetting, and stitch together the image data from discrete sensors into a single panorama. We compare processed images from the prototype to those taken with a 10× larger commercial camera with comparable field-of-view and light collection. © 2015 Optical Society of America.",,"Cameras; Focusing; Imaging systems; Impulse response; Lenses; Optical data processing; Optical fiber fabrication; Optical fibers; Spheres; Backside-illuminated; Digital image processing technique; High performance imaging; Mapping distortion; Monocentric lens; Optical fiber bundle; Silicon processing; Wide field of view; Image enhancement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942369992

Veracity is compromised by the occurrence of intentional deceptions. The nature of online news publication has changed, such that traditional fact checking and vetting from potential deception is impossible against the flood arising from content generators, as well as various formats and genres. The paper provides a typology of several varieties of veracity assessment methods emerging from two major categories – linguistic cue approaches (with machine learning), and network analysis approaches. We see promise in an innovative hybrid approach that combines linguistic cue and machine learning, with network-based behavioral data. Although designing a fake news detector is not a straightforward problem, we propose operational guidelines for a feasible fake news detecting system.

The increasingly widespread use of the Internet by the population to collect information regarding health and medical treatments and the circulation of many non-scientific documents on the effectiveness and safety of vaccines has led the Italian Society of Hygiene (SItI), in 2013, to promote a portal to provide scientific information that is verified and easily understood to counteract the rampant misinformation on health treatments and combat the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy. Methods. The project was launched in May 2013 and provides a portal with six main sections (vaccine preventable diseases, registered vaccines, benefits and risks of vaccination, against misinformation, pros & cons and travel immunizations) and other headings that relate to scientific events, comics and news coverage concerning vaccines. The contents are validated and evaluated by a scientific committee of high profile scientists and experts in computer-mediated communication. Results. In the first two years of activity, the portal has published more than 250 web pages on all aspects related to vaccinations. The number of individual users was 860,411, with a constant increase over time. Of these, about 21.7% returned to the website at least once. The total visits in 24 months were 1,099,670, with a total page count of 2,530,416. The frequency of contact was almost exclusively Italian (95.6%), with a higher proportion of males (54.1%) and younger age groups (25-34 years, 33.5%, and 18-24 years, 27.5%). The data also show a significant position of the website in the major web search engines. The website has been certified by the Health On the Net Foundation. It is connected with the main social networks and it has recently opened its first regional section (Veneto). Conclusions. The strong, progressive increase in web contacts, the involvement of several institutional bodies, and the appreciation of various stakeholders give an absolutely positive assessment of the first two years of the VaccinarSì project. The success of the website suggests future developments, with updates, sections devoted to regional problems, in-depth news analysis, and international expansion. The authors conclude that initiatives like this are to be implemented and constitute an effective way to counteract vaccine hesitancy.","Communication; Immunization; New media; Online portal; Vaccine hesitancy","vaccine; adult; attitude to health; economics; female; human; information seeking; information service; Internet; Italy; male; medical society; middle aged; organization and management; program evaluation; psychology; retrospective study; social media; social network; utilization; vaccination; young adult; Adult; Attitude to Health; Female; Humans; Information Seeking Behavior; Information Services; Internet; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Program Evaluation; Retrospective Studies; Social Media; Social Networking; Societies, Medical; Vaccination; Vaccines; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942287308

Government agencies that protect secrecy often have a difficult time connecting to the public (WGPC, 2014). Secretive, or perceived secretive government organizations often fall into the nebulous realm of uncertainty for the information consumer. This results in a great deal of misinformation and disinformation being thought of as correct (Hernon,). These types of wrong information are ubiquitous on the internet and even more so on social media, where rumors are often passed as truth. Since 2008, the US government is moving toward a more transparent, open, and easily accessed information base through social media (Lathrop & Ruma,). Agencies across the government are adopting types of social media communication. However, bureaus that primarily focus on security and safeguarding secrets struggle with how much to share and which platforms of social media are the ‘best’ for their message, and how to inure trust from their audience. This study is a content analysis of parent tweets from government agencies of the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, International Atomic Energy Agency, and National Security Agency (CIA, FBI, DHS, IAEA, and NSA) and the responses of the tweets from the public to assess the tone of message and response.

With the propagation of the internet, public health officials must now compete with other official and unofficial sources of information to get their message out. Aims: This study aimed at critically appraising videos available on one popular internet video site (YouTube) as a source of information for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Materials and Methods: Videos were searched in YouTube (http://www.youtube.com) using the keyword “Ebola outbreak” from inception to November 1, 2014 with the default “relevance” filter. Only videos in English language under 10 min duration within first 10 pages of search were included. Duplicates were removed and the rest were classified as useful or misleading by two independent reviewers. Video sources were categorized by source. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with kappa coefficient. Continuous and categorical variables were analyzed using the Student t-test and Chi-squared test, respectively. Results: One hundred and eighteen out of 198 videos were evaluated. Thirty-one (26.27%) videos were classified as misleading and 87 (73.73%) videos were classified as useful. The kappa coefficient of agreement regarding the usefulness of the videos was 0.68 (P < 0.001). Independent users were more likely to post misleading videos (93.55% vs 29.89%, OR = 34.02, 95% CI = 7.55-153.12, P < 0.001) whereas news agencies were most likely to post useful videos (65.52% vs 3.23%, OR = 57.00, 95% CI = 7.40-438.74, P < 0.001). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that majority of the internet videos about Ebola on YouTube were characterized as useful. Although YouTube seems to generally be a useful source of information on the current outbreak, increased efforts to disseminate scientifically correct information is desired to prevent unnecessary panic among the among the general population. © 2015 North American Journal of Medical Sciences.","Ebola; Information; Videos; YouTube","acquired immune deficiency syndrome; airborne infection; Article; Ebolavirus; health care organization; human; human computer interaction; information retrieval; Internet; medical information; videorecording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937406838

This study aimed to investigate the practice of self-medication with antibiotics to treat URTIs in Australian Chinese migrants and to understand whether their knowledge of antibiotics, attitudes to and perceptions of antibiotic use was associated with self-medication of antibiotics. Methods Four hundred and seventeen participants were recruited in an online health survey involving a bilingual questionnaire through several Australian-based Chinese social websites. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to explore the associations between self-medication and antibiotic-related knowledge, attitudes, and perception factors. Results Around 24.2% of Chinese migrants used antibiotics without medical consultation for URTIs. Almost 70% of Chinese migrants indicated that they would stop taking antibiotics when symptoms improved; around 61% would use leftover antibiotics if they had similar symptoms. Furthermore, participants who would use leftover antibiotics (OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.7-5.6), or who would take an incomplete course of antibiotics (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0-3.1) were more likely to report self-medication with antibiotics. Participants who perceived it was appropriate to use antibiotics for fever, cough and sore throat were at a greater risk of self-medication with antibiotics for URTIs. Conclusion A considerable number of Chinese migrants used antibiotics for URTIs without medical consultation in Australia. Misperceptions about antibiotic use were significantly associated with the practice of self-medicating in this group. The findings provided important information for developing culturally responsive interventions for the correct use of antibiotics in Australian Chinese communities.

Nine patients with a prominent mandibular angle were enrolled in this study. A pair of stereolithographic templates was fabricated by computer-aided image design and 3D printing. In all cases, bilateral MAO was performed under the guide of these templates. Post-operative effects were evaluated by 3D curve functions and maximal shell-to-shell deviations.Background: Mandibular angle ostectomy (MAO) is commonly used to correct prominent mandibular angles through an intraoral approach. However, limited vision in the operative site may lead to difficulties or complications during surgery. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective method for helping surgeons to perform MAO more precisely and safely.Results: All patients were satisfied with their cosmetic outcomes. The mean and SD of ICC between R-Sim and R-Post were 0.958 ± 0.011; between L-Sim and L-Post, 0.965 ± 0.014; and between R-Post and L-Post, 0.964 ± 0.013. The maximal shell-to-shell deviations between the simulated mandibular contour and post-operative mandibular contour on the right and left sides were 2.02 ± 0.32 and 1.97 ± 0.41 mm, respectively.Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that this new technique could assist surgeons in making better pre-surgical plans and ensure more accurate and safer manipulation for completion of this procedure.Level of Evidence V: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

In areas of low bone presentation, standardized plate-like titanium implants are available. For allowing a congruent fitting to the recipient site, these contemporary implants have to be manually adapted-implicating drawbacks in terms of time consumption, technical complexity, and insufficient functional outcome. Owing to these limitations, a custom-made patient-specific implant is introduced based on Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data and designed for optimal prosthetic reconstruction. Methods: For the first time, the application of a prefabricated patientspecific implant for retaining a craniofacial prosthesis is described. In a 64-year-old man with partial nasal defect standardized plate-like implants failed because of compromised bone quality due to Osler disease. To realize an implant-retained prosthetic reconstruction, a patient-specific implant was fabricated based on computer-Aided design and computer-Aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology. This technique allows for considering the implant's ideal geometry as well as its correct placement of the required magnetic abutments. Furthermore, the surface of the implant can be designed for optimal hygienic conditions. Results: The patient-specific implant was successfully inserted in a time effective operating procedure. Follow-up at 6 months showed an excellent functional and aesthetic outcome. Conclusions: Application of prefabricated patient-specific implants offers prospectively an ideal tool for retaining craniofacial prostheses and should be considered a viable option in standard cases, but obligatory in anatomically demanding defects.

By utilizing inexpensive manufacturing methods such as ink-jet printing and roll-to-roll imprinting, flexible electronics can be made on low-cost plastic films just like printing newspapers. However, the key elements of flexible electronics, thin-film transistors (TFTs), have slower operating speeds and are less reliable than their Si electronics counterparts. Furthermore, TFTs are usually mono-type - either p- or n-type - devices. Making air-stable complementary TFT circuits is very challenging or sometimes not feasible to most TFT technologies. Existing design methodologies for Si electronics, therefore, cannot be directly applied to flexible electronics. Other factors such as high supply voltage, large process variation, and lack of trustworthy device modeling also make designing larger-scale and robust TFT circuits a significant challenge. The objective of this article is to provide an in-depth overview of flexible electronics from their applications, manufacturing processes, device characteristics, to circuit and system design solutions. We first introduce the low-cost fabrication methods for flexible electronics, including ink-jet printing, screen printing, and gravure printing. The device characteristics and compact modeling of several major TFT technologies will be illustrated. We will then give an overview of digital and analog circuit design from basic logic gates to a microprocessor, as well as design automation tools and methods, for designing flexible electronics. We also describe a reliability simulation framework that can predict TFT circuits' performance degradation under bias-stress. This framework has been validated using the amorphous-silicon (a-Si) TFT scan driver for TFT-LCD displays. Finally, we will give an overview of flexible thin-film photovoltaics using different materials including amorphous silicon, CdTe, CIGS, and organic solar cells. © 2015 T.-C. Huang, J.-L.

This requires stakeholders to radically re-think their existing business models (and thinking that underpins them), but also the technological challenges and skills required to deliver these projects. Whilst opponents will no doubt cite that this is nothing new as the sector as a whole has always had to respond to change the counter to this is that design 'creativity' is now much more dependent on integration from day one. Given this, collaborative processes embedded in Building Information Modelling (BIM) models have been proffered as a panacea solution to embrace this change and deliver streamlined integration. The veracity of design teams' ""project data"" is increasingly becoming paramount-not only for the coordination of design, processes, engineering services, fabrication, construction, and maintenance; but more importantly, facilitate 'true' project integration and interchange-the actualisation of which will require firm consensus and commitment. This Special Issue envisions some of these issues, challenges and opportunities (from a future landscape perspective), by highlighting a raft of concomitant factors, which include: Technological challenges, design visualisation and integration, future digital tools, new and anticipated operating environments, and training requirements needed to deliver these aspirations. A fundamental part of this Special Issue's 'call' was to capture best practice in order to demonstrate how design, visualisation and delivery processes (and technologies) affect the finished product viz: Design outcome, design procedures, production methodologies and construction implementation. In this respect, the use of virtual environments are now particularly effective at supporting the design and delivery processes. In summary therefore, this Special Issue presents nine papers from leading scholars, industry and contemporaries. These papers provide an eclectic (but cognate) representation of AEC design visualisation and integration; which not only uncovers new insight and understanding of these challenges and solutions, but also provides new theoretical and practice signposts for future research. © 2015 Archnet-IJAR.","Building Information Modelling; Collaborative Working; Decision Support Systems; Design Visualisation; Innovative Design Interfaces",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950157745

Social norms theory suggests correcting these inflated perceptions can reduce alcohol consumption. Recent findings by the current authors show portraying oneself as 'a drinker' is considered by many students to be a socially desirable component of their Facebook identity, perpetuating an online culture that normalises binge drinking. However, social networking sites have yet to be utilised in social norms interventions. Design and Methods: Actual and perceived descriptive and injunctive drinking norms were collected from 244 university students. Ninety-five students screened positive for hazardous drinking and were randomly allocated to a control group or intervention group that received social norms feedback via personalised Facebook private messages over three sessions. Results: At 1 month post-intervention, the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumed by intervention group during the previous month had significantly reduced compared with baseline and controls. Reductions were maintained 3 months post-intervention. Intervention group perceived drinking norms were significantly more accurate post-intervention. Discussion and Conclusions: This is the first study to test the feasibility of using Facebook to deliver social norms interventions. Correcting misperceptions of peer drinking norms resulted in clinically significant reductions in alcohol use. Facebook has many advantages over traditional social norms delivery, providing an innovative method for tackling problem drinking at university. These results have implications for the use of Facebook to deliver positive messages about safe alcohol use to students, which may counter the negative messages regarding alcohol normally seen on Facebook.

The temporal resolution of the conventional pulse-shrinking mechanism is determined by the size ratio between homogeneous and inhomogeneous elements. The proposed scheme which features double-stage operation derives its resolution according to the time difference between pulse-shrinking and pulse-stretching amounts. Thus, it can achieve greater immunity against temperature and ambient variations than that of the single-stage scheme. The circuit area also can be reduced by the proposed pulse-mixing scheme. In addition, this study proposes an improved cyclic delay line to eliminate the undesirable shift in the temporal resolution successfully. Therefore, the effective resolution can be controlled completely by the pulse-mixing unit to improve accuracy. The proposed TDC composed of only one cyclic delay line and one counter is fabricated in a TSMC CMOS 0.35-μm DPQM process. The chip core occupies an extremely small area of 0.02 mm2, which is the best among the related works. The experimental result shows that an effective resolution of around 53 ps within ±13% variation over a 0-100°C temperature range is achieved. The power consumption is 90 μW at a sample rate of 1000 samples/s. In addition to the reduced area, the proposed TDC circuit achieves its resolution with less thermal-sensitivity and better fluctuations caused by process variations. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.",,"Delay circuits; Frequency converters; Sensitivity analysis; Shrinkage; Signal processing; Effective resolutions; Process Variation; Temperature range; Temporal resolution; Thermal-sensitivity; Time to digital converters; Time to digital converters (TDCs); Time-differences; Mixing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909594851

The authors describe such a case in the esthetic zone whereby flapless extraction and immediate implant placement using CT-guided surgery were performed simultaneously, with placement of a computer-aided design/computer-aided manufactured (CAD/CAM) patient-specific abutment and non-occlusal function provisional in a single visit (supporting the ""one-abutment, one-time"" concept). An over-retained primary cuspid in a periodontally healthy woman with well-controlled type-2 diabetes was replaced with an implant and CAD/CAM patient-specific abutment in the No. 11 position. A necessary implant-axis angle correction was customized using digital information from a CBCT scan and implant treatment planning software, without the need for site development or a conventional impression. This data integration and streamlined workflow enabled fabrication of a CAD/CAM patient-specific abutment before surgical treatment. The abutment remained in place from implant surgery to the prosthetic phase, with minimal soft-tissue changes, enabling preservation of pink esthetics and expediting treatment. The result was a preserved emergence profile in the presence of high esthetic demands. However, due to slight post-extraction soft-tissue changes, digital reformatting of the abutment was required when the final crown was fabricated, thus limiting the disruption of the biologic width to a one-time occurrence. The importance of case selection for this treatment protocol in the esthetic zone cannot be overemphasized. A thick crestal dentoalveolar bone phenotype (> 1 mm, approaching 2 mm in this case), broad zone of attached and keratinized gingiva (3 mm to 4 mm in this case), adequate peri-implant soft-tissue thickness (> 1 mm in this case), and high primary implant stability (ISQ = 80 in this case) were all critical factors influencing outcome.",,"tooth implant; ceramics; dental abutment; dental procedure; human; tooth implant; tooth occlusion; Ceramics; Dental Abutments; Dental Implants; Dental Occlusion; Esthetics, Dental; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979966367

The rise of Twitter as a key venue for political journalists would seem to support their fact-checking activities. Through a content analysis of political journalists’ Twitter discourse surrounding the 2012 presidential debates, this study examines the degree to which fact-checking techniques were used on Twitter and the ways in which journalists on Twitter adhered to the practices of either “professional” or “scientific” objectivity—the mode that underlies the fact-checking enterprise—or disregarded objectivity altogether. A typology of tweets indicates that fact checking played a notable but secondary role in journalists’ Twitter discourse. Professional objectivity, especially simple stenography, dominated reporting practices on Twitter, and opinion and commentary were also prevalent. We determine that Twitter is indeed conducive to some elements of fact checking. But taken as a whole, our data suggest that journalists and commentators posted opinionated tweets about the candidates’ claims more often than they fact checked those claims. © The Author(s) 2014.","debates; elections; fact checking; journalism; norms and routines; objectivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908144222

By incorporating examples of pseudoscience into lectures, instructors can provide students with the tools needed to understand the difference between scientific and pseudoscientific or paranormal claims. We discuss examples involving psychics, ghosts, aliens, and other phenomena in relation to scientific thinking. In light of research literature demonstrating that presenting and dispelling scientific misconceptions in the classroom is an effective means of countering non-scientific or pseudoscientific beliefs, we provide examples of pseudoscience that can be used to help students acquire healthy skepticism while avoiding cynicism. From Dr. Oz promoting homeopathy to Deepak Chopra extolling the virtues of quantum healing, students are bombarded with questionable claims that require careful examination. Although students have access to more information than ever before, many do not possess the skills to distinguish good information from bad. Exacerbating this problem is the prevalence of pseudoscientific information available in the popular media, online, and even the classroom (Lilienfeld et al., 2004; Losh and Nzekwe, 2011; Novella, 2013). The purpose of this article is to provide examples that challenge students and provide instructors with tools to enhance scientific thinking. To do so, we describe how to distinguish science from pseudoscience, and provide several examples that can be used to promote scientific thinking. Specifically, we want to encourage students to employ scientific skepticism. Scientific skepticism means approaching claims with an open mind, and a willingness to accept only those claims that have survived scrutiny in rigorous scientific tests (Sagan, 1995). Skepticism differs from cynicism, which implies close-mindedness to novel claims. Through unique class demonstrations, assignments, and lecture material, instructors can use pseudoscience as a vehicle to engage students and foster scientific skepticism (see Stanovich, 2012 as a valuable resource). Teaching scientific methods and the nature of science alone is not sufficient to help students distinguish science from pseudoscience. Data from educational psychology suggest that unless misconceptions are addressed explicitly in coursework, they will frequently persist (e.g., Winer et al., 2002). Overcoming students' naïve scientific beliefs is a significant challenge for educators, as researchers have found that these beliefs can endure even after the acquisition of incompatible scientific theories (Shtulman and Valcarcel, 2012). In a survey of 10,000 American students over a 20-year period, there was only a modest decline in pseudoscientific beliefs following an undergraduate degree, even for students who had taken two or three science courses (Impey et al., 2012). At the same time, there is hope. Researchers have found that short-term skeptical thinking improves among students who have had direct exposure to the refutation of pseudoscientific claims (Kowalski and Taylor, 2009; Manza et al., 2010), although long-term follow-ups are needed to corroborate these findings. Incorporating examples of scientific misconceptions in lectures can be a valuable tool for science educators to help students overcome erroneous scientific beliefs and distinguish science from pseudoscience (see Lilienfeld et al., 2001 for a brief review of the literature). © 2014 Schmaltz and Lilienfeld.","Introductory psychology; Pseudoscience; Scientific thinking; Skepticism; Teaching resources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899692750

Follow-up assessments were conducted online at 3 and 6. months. Latent growth modeling was used to provide effect size estimates for the influence of intervention on outcomes. One thousand and eighty undergraduate students completed screening. The intervention did not influence marijuana use frequency. However, there was evidence of a small overall intervention effect on marijuana-related consequences and a medium effect in stratified analyses in the on-site condition. Analyses of psychological variables showed that the intervention significantly reduced perceived norms regarding peer marijuana use. These findings demonstrate that it is feasible to identify marijuana users in SHS and deliver an automated web-based intervention to these students in different contexts. Effect size estimates suggest that the intervention has some promise as a means of correcting misperceptions of marijuana use norms and reducing marijuana-related consequences. Future work should test the efficacy of this intervention in a full scale randomized controlled trial. © 2013.","Cannabis; College student; Computer; Prevention; Student health","cannabis; adult; article; cannabis use; controlled study; feasibility study; female; follow up; health behavior; health care planning; health center; health service; human; Internet; major clinical study; male; online system; pilot study; psychological aspect; randomized controlled trial; screening; student satisfaction; treatment outcome; undergraduate student; Cannabis; College student; Computer; Prevention; Student health; Adult; Boston; Feasibility Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Behavior; Humans; Internet; Male; Marijuana Abuse; Mass Screening; Patient Satisfaction; Peer Group; Pilot Projects; Questionnaires; Student Health Services; Students; Treatment Outcome; Universities; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84901014956

Adequate dissemination of correct information about the disease would have helped decrease its spread and the associated panic in the general population. In this study, we looked into the use of YouTube as a resource for providing information about West Nile Virus infection. Objective This study aims to identify and evaluate YouTube as resource for providing information on West Nile Virus infection to the general public. Methods YouTube was searched on November 25, 2012, using the keywords West Nile Virus epidemic, West Nile Virus infection, and West Nile Virus prevention for videos uploaded in the past 6 months containing relevant information about the disease. The videos were classified as useful, misleading, or as news updates based on the type of information contained. Total viewership, number of days since upload, total duration of videos, and source of upload were noted. Results A total of 106 videos with information on West Nile Virus infection were included in the study, with 79.24% having useful information about the disease. Among the useful videos, 51/84 (60.71%) had information on disease prevention, and 29/84 (34.52%) contained information on news and research updates. The majority of these videos were uploaded by individuals (54.6%) or news agencies (41.8 %). Healthcare agencies contributed only 3.4 % of the total videos. Even though the useful videos represented 72% of all videos, there was significantly higher total viewership and viewership per day for the non-useful videos (P<0.05). Conclusions YouTube may be a significant resource for dissemination of information on public health issues like West Nile virus infection and should be targeted by healthcare agencies for this use. The major drawback of this medium is lack of verification by authorized healthcare professionals before these videos are made available for viewing by the community. Hence, a strict caution should be exercised in obtaining the information from unauthorized videos posted on YouTube. © 2014 Marshfield Clinic.","Infection; West nile virus; YouTube","Article; controlled study; epidemic; Flavivirus infection; health care access; health care availability; health care organization; human; infection prevention; information dissemination; prevalence; primary prevention; public health service; secondary prevention; social media; United States; West Nile flavivirus infection; consumer health information; epidemic; Internet; public health; standards; statistics and numerical data; videorecording; West Nile fever; Consumer Health Information; Epidemics; Humans; Internet; Public Health; United States; Video Recording; West Nile Fever",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922341389

Microfluidic sensors and the integration of sensors with microfluidic systems are often described as miniature versions of their macro-scale counterparts. This technology presents unique advantages for handling costly and difficult-to-obtain samples and reagents as a typical system requires between 100 nL to 10 μL of working fluid. The fabrication of a fully functional cell-based biosensor utilizes both biological patterning and microfabrication techniques. A digital micro-mirror (photolithographic) system is initiated to construct the tissue platform while a cell printer is used to precisely embed the cells within the construct. Tissue construct developed with these technologies will provide an early diagnostic of a drug's potential use. A three-dimensional interconnected microfluidic environment has the potential to eliminate the limitations of the traditional mainstays of two-dimensional investigations.

Food safety professionals play an important role in protecting the public from foodborne illness. A survey of food safety professionals (n = 314) was conducted to characterize their knowledge of NoVs and to identify gaps in this knowledge. To recruit individuals, 25 professional organizations promoted the survey via their Web sites, newsletters, and/or e-mail distribution lists. The survey used true or false and open-ended questions to assess knowledge about NoVs, including attribution, transmission, and prevention and control strategies, including food handling practices. The online survey was available from mid October 2012 to mid-January 2013. Of the 314 respondents, 66.2% correctly identified NoVs as one of the three most common causes of foodborne disease in the United States. Only 5.4% of respondents correctly identified the three most common settings for NoV infections, and 65.0% of respondents had the misperception that cruise ships are one of the three most common settings. Seventeen respondents (5.4%) answered all 20 true-or-false questions correctly, 33 respondents (10.5%) answered at least 19 of the 20 questions correctly, and 186 respondents (65.0%) answered at least 15 of the 20 questions correctly (i.e., a score of 75% or higher). The content domain in which respondents had the most incorrect answers was food handling practices. Thirty-eight percent of respondents incorrectly responded that it is safe for restaurant workers infected with NoVs to handle packaged food, food equipment, and utensils. About half of respondents did not know the recommended sanitizing solution for eliminating NoVs from a contaminated surface. The survey findings identified several important gaps in food safety professionals' knowledge of NoVs. The study results will inform the development of a Web-based educational module on NoVs to improve efforts to prevent the spread of NoVs in retail and institutional food establishments.",,"adult; attitude to health; calicivirus infection; catering service; female; food handling; food poisoning; food safety; human; information processing; male; manpower; middle aged; Norovirus; physiology; psychology; United States; virology; Adult; Caliciviridae Infections; Data Collection; Female; Food Handling; Food Safety; Foodborne Diseases; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Norovirus; Restaurants; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921669301

It is urgent and significant to assess the reliability of such techniques applied in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the security of existing digital image contrast enhancement (CE) forensic algorithms. From the standpoint of attackers, we propose two types of attacks, CE trace hiding attack and CE trace forging attack, which could invalidate the forensic detector and fabricate two types of forensic errors, respectively. The CE trace hiding attack is implemented by integrating local random dithering into the design of pixel value mapping. The CE trace forging attack is proposed by modifying the gray level histogram of a target pixel region to counterfeit peak/gap artifacts. Such trace forging attack is typically applied to create sophisticated composite images which could deceive the prior CE-based composition detectors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed CE anti-forensic schemes. © 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","anti-forensics; attack; composite image; contrast enhancement; digital forensics; histogram","Forging; Graphic methods; Pixels; Anti-Forensics; attack; Composite images; Contrast Enhancement; Digital forensic; histogram; Image processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891652861

In this paper, we present a set of algorithms for the reverse engineering of digital circuits starting from an unstructured netlist and resulting in a high-level netlist with components such as register files, counters, adders, and subtractors. Our techniques require no manual intervention and experiments show that they determine the functionality of >45% and up to 93% of the gates in each of the test circuits that we examine. We also demonstrate that our algorithms are scalable to real designs by experimenting with a very large, highly-optimized system-on-chip (SOC) design with over 375000 combinational elements. Our inference algorithms cover 68% of the gates in this SOC. We also demonstrate that our algorithms are effective in aiding a human analyst to detect hardware Trojans in an unstructured netlist. © 2013 IEEE.","computer security; design automation; Digital circuits; formal verification","Adders; Algorithms; Application specific integrated circuits; Computer aided design; Computer hardware; Design; Digital circuits; Electron beam lithography; Formal verification; Hardware; Hardware security; Inference engines; Integrated circuits; Malware; Microprocessor chips; Programmable logic controllers; Reverse engineering; Security of data; System-on-chip; Design automations; Hardware Trojans; Inference algorithm; Integrated circuits (ICs); Manual intervention; Multi-vendor environment; Optimized system; Register files; Integrated circuit design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84909997351

In order to satisfy the severe requirement of a wide range operating temperature under the given constraints, the ADC was simplified by eliminating nonessential building blocks such as reference drivers, a sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA), and level shifters. The proposed internal signal amplification method extends the effective signal range in both multiplying digital-to-analog converter and flash ADC, as well as the error correction range. A new clock generation circuit for a SHA-less pipelined ADC removes the need for a higher frequency external clock. The prototype ADC was fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process. The ADC core consumes 23.4 mW at 3.3-V/1.8-V supplies.

Design: A 2 × 2 × 5 between-subjects Web-based experiment. Parents were randomly shown an advertisement (counter-advertisement challenging FOPP/control advertisement) and then a pair of food products from the same category: an unhealthy product featuring an FOPP (nutrient content claim/sports celebrity endorsement) and a healthier control product with no FOPP. Setting: Australia. Participants: A total of 1,269 Australian-based parents of children aged 5-12 years recruited from an online panel. Main Outcome Measures: Parents nominated which product they would prefer to buy and which they thought was healthier, then rated the unhealthy product and FOPP on various characteristics. Analysis: Differences between advertisement conditions were assessed using logistic regression (product choice tasks) and analysis of variance tests (ratings of unhealthy product and FOPP). Results: Compared with parents who saw a control advertisement, parents who saw a counter-advertisement perceived unhealthy products featuring FOPPs as less healthy, expressed weaker intentions for buying such products, and were more likely to read the nutrition facts panel before nominating choices (all P < .001). Conclusions and Implications: Counter-advertising may help reduce the misleading influence of unhealthy food marketing and improve the accuracy of parents' evaluations of how nutritious promoted food products are. © 2014 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.","Advertising; Front-of-package labeling; Front-of-package promotions; Marketing; Nutrition; Parents","adverse effects; athlete; attitude to health; Australia; child; controlled study; economics; education; fast food; female; food packaging; fraud; health care policy; human; Internet; male; nutritional science; parent; patient education; preschool child; public figure; randomized controlled trial; Athletes; Australia; Child; Child Nutrition Sciences; Child, Preschool; Famous Persons; Fast Foods; Female; Food Packaging; Fraud; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Internet; Male; Nutrition Policy; Parents; Patient Education as Topic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926199086

US students overestimate how much their peers drink and correcting this through the use of social norm messages may promote responsible drinking. Objectives: We tested whether there is an association between perceived campus drinking norms and usual drinking behavior in UK university students and whether norm messages about responsible drinking correct normative misperceptions and increase students' intentions to drink responsibly. Method: 1,020 UK university students took part in an online study. Participants were exposed to one of five message types: a descriptive norm, an injunctive norm, a descriptive and injunctive norm, or one of two control messages. Message credibility was assessed. Afterwards participants completed measures of intentions to drink responsibly and we measured usual drinking habits and perceptions of peer drinking. Results: Perceptions of peer drinking were associated modestly with usual drinking behavior, whereby participants who believed other students drank responsibly also drank responsibly. Norm messages changed normative perceptions, but not in the target population of participants who underestimated responsible drinking in their peers at baseline. Norm messages did not increase intentions to drink responsibly and although based on accurate data, norm messages were not seen as credible. Conclusions: In this UK based study, although perceived social norms about peer drinking were associated with individual differences in drinking habits, campus wide norm messages about responsible drinking did not affect students' intentions to drink more responsibly. More research is required to determine if this approach can be applied to UK settings. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Alcohol use; Drinking intentions; Peer misperceptions; Problem drinking; Social norms","adolescent; adult; behavior; controlled study; drinking behavior; female; human; male; peer group; perception; psychology; randomized controlled trial; social environment; social norm; social psychology; student; university; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Peer Group; Social Conformity; Social Environment; Social Norms; Social Perception; Students; Universities; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905034720

There is an unresolved debate on the etiology of this problem. Research has shown that occlusal interferences affect masticatory muscle comfort, coordination, and function. Resolution of these problems with precise occlusal correction indicates that dental occlusion is a causative or contributory factor in myogenous orofacial pain. However, some studies fail to confirm this and instead conclude that occlusion is unrelated to masticatory muscle pain or dysfunction. An explanation for this discrepancy in findings is that these nonconfirmatory studies had not documented any pretreatment or corrected occlusion. Diagnostic casts mounted in centric relation and precision occlusal splints are accurate modalities to diagnose the occlusal problem and its correction in a patient with myogenous orofacial pain. Computerized digital occlusal analysis provides objective data of occlusal contact time and force to accurately assess diagnosis and treatment.

Carbon nanotube FETs (CNFETs) are excellent candidates for further energy reduction, as CNFET-based digital circuits are projected to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in energy-delay product compared with silicon-CMOS at highly scaled technology nodes. However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are inherently subject to imperfections and variations such as those induced by mispositioned and metallic CNTs. These substantial imperfections and variations have prevented the demonstration of complex CNFET circuits until now. This paper presents the first demonstration of a subsystem, which is a complete capacitive sensor interface circuit, implemented entirely using CNFETs that can be fabricated reproducibly in a VLSI-compatible fashion. This is made possible by: 1) a digitally oriented interface architecture and 2) the imperfection-immune design paradigm, which combines design and processing techniques to successfully overcome CNT imperfections and variations. In addition to electrical measurements, we demonstrate correct operation of our CNFET circuitry by interfacing it with a sensor used to control a handshaking robot. © 2013 IEEE.","Carbon nanotube (CNT); Carbon nanotube FET (CNFET); Sensor interface circuit","Capacitive sensor interface; Carbon nanotube fets (CNFET); Electrical measurement; Energy delay product; Interface architecture; Low power application; Processing technique; Sensor interface circuits; Energy utilization; Logic circuits; Sensors; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891629293

The aim of the present study was to introduce the application of a digital occlusal splint (DOS) in the assistance of CCG to treat ankylosis and mandibular deviation simultaneously. Materials and Methods We designed and implemented a retrospective cohort study and enrolled a sample of growing pediatric patients with unilateral TMJ ankylosis and mandibular deviation who were treated for CCG at our department. The predictor variable was preoperative three-dimensional treatment planning and splint construction (DOS) compared with intraoperative treatment planning and splint fabrication (conventional occlusal splint [COS]). The primary outcome variables were the postoperative ramus height and chin deviation correction measured using Proplan CMF, version 1.3 software. The secondary outcome variable was the treatment time. Data from the 2 methods were compared using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software package, version 13.0. Results A total of 8 children, 4 with a COS and 4 with a DOS were included in the present study. The treatment time was significantly longer in the COS group (mean 9.625 hours) than in the DOS group (mean 6.75 hours). The ramus height and chin deviation correction after surgery were more accurate in the DOS group (mean 2.09 mm and 1.29°, respectively) than in the COS group (mean 5.44 mm and 3.27°, respectively), but without significance (P >.05). Conclusions The preoperative fabrication of DOSs compared with the intraoperative fabrication of COSs resulted in a shorter treatment time and improved mandibular deviation correction in the treatment of children with unilateral TMJ ankylosis. © 2014 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.",,"article; bone graft; child; childhood disease; clinical article; cohort analysis; computer aided design; Costochondral graft; digital occlusal splint; female; human; male; occlusal splint; operation duration; osteotomy; outcome assessment; preoperative period; retrospective study; temporomandibular ankylosis; treatment duration; treatment planning; Ankylosis; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Male; Mandibular Condyle; Occlusal Splints; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Temporomandibular Joint Disorders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904718446

This poses susceptibility to RF Interference (RFI) and may initiate failure states ranging from degraded navigation accuracy to a complete signal loss condition. To guarantee the integrity of the received GNSS signal, the receiver should either be able to function in the presence of RFI without generating misleading information (i.e., offering a navigation solution within an accuracy limit), or the receiver must detect RFI so that some other means could be used as a countermeasure in order to ensure robust and accurate navigation. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to identify an interference occurrence and not to confuse it with other signal conditions, for example, indoor or deep urban canyon, both of which have somewhat similar impact on the navigation performance. Hence, in this paper, the objective is to investigate the effect of interference on different GNSS receiver observables in two different environments: i. an interference scenario with an inexpensive car jammer, and ii. an outdoorindoor scenario without any intentional interference. The investigated observables include the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) measurements, the digitized IF (Intermediate Frequency) signal levels, the Delay Locked Loop and the Phase Locked Loop discriminator variances, and the Carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N0) measurements. The behavioral pattern of these receiver observables is perceived in these two different scenarios in order to comprehend which of those observables would be able to separate an interference situation from an indoor scenario, since in both the cases, the resulting positioning accuracy and/or availability are affected somewhat similarly. A new Running Digital Sum (RDS) -based interference detection method is also proposed herein that can be used as an alternate to AGC-based interference detection. It is shown in this paper that it is not at all wise to consider certain receiver observables for interference detection (i.e., C/N0); rather it is beneficial to utilize certain specific observables, such as the RDS of raw digitized signal levels or the AGC-based observables that can uniquely identify a critical malicious interference occurrence.","GNSS; In-car jammer; Interference detection; Jamming; Receiver observables",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907090195

Numerous models have been devised to describe this process, including epidemic models and spin models, which mainly focus on how opinions spread and interact with each other, respectively. In this paper, we propose a model that combines the spreading stage and the interaction stage for opinions to illustrate the process of dispelling a rumor. Moreover, we set up authoritative nodes, which disseminate positive opinion to counterbalance the negative opinion prevailing on online social networking sites. With analysis of the relationship among positive opinion proportion, opinion strength and the density of authoritative nodes in networks with different topologies, we demonstrate that the positive opinion proportion grows with the density of authoritative nodes until the positive opinion prevails in the entire network. In particular, the relationship is linear in homogeneous topologies. Besides, it is also noteworthy that initial locations of the negative opinion source and authoritative nodes do not influence positive opinion proportion in homogeneous networks but have a significant impact on heterogeneous networks.

At the current state of the art, quantum bits (qubits) are fabricated, initialized, controlled, read out and coupled to each other in simple circuits. This enables the realization of basic logic gates, the creation of complex entangled states and the demonstration of algorithms or error correction. Using different variants of low-noise parametric amplifiers, dispersive quantum non-demolition single-shot readout of single-qubit states with high fidelity has enabled continuous and discrete feedback control of single qubits. Here we realize full deterministic quantum teleportation with feed-forward in a chip-based superconducting circuit architecture. We use a set of two parametric amplifiers for both joint two-qubit and individual qubit single-shot readout, combined with flexible real-time digital electronics. Our device uses a crossed quantum bus technology that allows us to create complex networks with arbitrary connecting topology in a planar architecture. The deterministic teleportation process succeeds with order unit probability for any input state, as we prepare maximally entangled two-qubit states as a resource and distinguish all Bell states in a single two-qubit measurement with high efficiency and high fidelity. We teleport quantum states between two macroscopic systems separated by 6 mm at a rate of 10 4 s -1, exceeding other reported implementations. The low transmission loss of superconducting waveguides is likely to enable the range of this and other schemes to be extended to significantly larger distances, enabling tests of non-locality and the realization of elements for quantum communication at microwave frequencies. The demonstrated feed-forward may also find application in error correction schemes. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Speed and function density of FPGAs are increasing as transistor sizes shrink to the nanoscale. As these transistors reduce in size intrinsic variability becomes more of a problem and to reliably create electronic designs according to specification time consuming statistical simulations become necessary; and even with accurate models and statistical simulation, the fabrication yield will decrease as every physical instance of a design behaves differently. This paper describes an adaptive, evolvable architecture that allows for correction and optimization of circuits directly in hardware using bioinspired techniques. Similar to FPGAs, the programmable analog and digital array (PAnDA) architecture introduced provides a digital configuration layer for circuit design. Accessing additional configuration options of the underlying analog layer enables continuous adjustment of circuit characteristics at runtime, which enables dynamic optimization of the mapped design's performance. Moreover, the yield of devices can be improved postfabrication via reconfiguration of the analog layer, which can overcome faults induced due to variability and process defects. Since optimization goals are generic, i.e., not restricted to reducing stochastic variability, power consumption or increasing speed, the same mechanisms can also enhance the device's fault tolerant abilities in the case of component degradation and failures during its lifetime or when exposed to hazardous environments. © 1968-2012 IEEE.","adaptive hardware; bio-inspired algorithms; evolvable hardware; fault tolerance; intrinsic variability; Reconfigurable architectures","Bio-inspired algorithms; Bio-inspired techniques; Configuration options; Evolvable hardware; Fault tolerant ability; Hazardous environment; Intrinsic variabilities; Statistical simulation; Computer hardware; Design; Fault tolerance; Hardware; Integrated circuit manufacture; Linear regression; Models; Optimization; Reconfigurable architectures; Reconfigurable hardware; Signal processing; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880147752

Phishing has seen an alarming trend of increase in both the volume and the sophistication of phishing attacks. According to a description of phishing by APWG, the ways phishers steal consumers' personal information consist of social engineering and technical subterfuge. In technical-subterfuge schemes, phishers furtively plant crime ware onto users' computers to intercept their online account user names and passwords, while in social-engineering schemes they send spoofed e-mails to consumers purporting to be from legitimate businesses and agencies and then mislead consumers to counterfeit websites. When a user wants to access the website, the server sends an encrypted security code to the user through the communication protocol. If the user's login name is not valid it will show an error message. If the user's name is valid, the website checks the user's registered account and sends an acknowledgement to that user. The legitimate or true webpage mimicked by the fake webpage is defined as the phishing target. Such phishing attacks if executed on newly created web pages prove difficult to identify as it becomes hard to tell which the phishing page is and which the target is. We anticipate that our approach would be deployed for websites requiring a high level of security and that it would ultimately help in remaining customer confidence in using web-based commerce. The automatic discovery of phishing target is proposed to solve the above problem. ©2013 Science Publications.","Anti-Phishing; Attacks; Spoofed E-Mails; Website",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880155119

The existing analyses of CSR in the alcohol industry point to the misleading nature of these CSR practices. Yet, research has been relatively sparse on how the alcohol industry advances CSR in an attempt to facilitate underlying business interests, and in what ways the ongoing display of industry CSR impacts public health. This paper aims to investigate the alcohol industry's recent CSR engagements and explain how CSR forms part of the industry's wider political and corporate strategies. Methods. Our study used qualitative methods to collect and analyse data. We searched for materials pertaining to CSR activities from websites of three transnational alcohol corporations, social media platforms, media reports and other sources. Relevant documents were thematically analysed with an iterative approach. Results: Our analysis identified three CSR tactics employed by the alcohol companies which are closely tied in with the industry's underlying corporate intents. First, the alcohol manufacturers employ CSR as a means to frame issues, define problems and guide policy debates. In doing this, the alcohol companies are able to deflect and shift the blame from those who manufacture and promote alcoholic products to those who consume them. Second, the alcohol corporations promote CSR initiatives on voluntary regulation in order to delay and offset alcohol control legislation. Third, the alcohol corporations undertake philanthropic sponsorships as a means of indirect brand marketing as well as gaining preferential access to emerging alcohol markets. Conclusions: The increasing penetration and involvement of the alcohol industry into CSR highlights the urgent needs for public health counter actions. Implementation of any alcohol control measures should include banning or restricting the publicity efforts of the industry's CSR and informing the public of the alcohol industry's notion of social responsibility. More significantly, an internationally binding instrument should be called for to enable countries to differentiate between genuine concerns and spurious altruism, and in doing so, resist the industry's attempt to erode alcohol control. © 2013 Yoon and Lam; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Alcohol industry; Alcohol policies; Corporate social responsibility; Framework convention; Politics","alcoholic beverage; article; ethics; food industry; human; politics; qualitative research; social behavior; Alcoholic Beverages; Food Industry; Humans; Politics; Qualitative Research; Social Responsibility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879820323

We analyzed the source, content and accuracy of IBD videos found on YouTube- one of the most popular websites in the United States - and assessed the demographic variables of the viewers. Methods: The 100 most viewed videos with relevant information on IBD were analyzed. We included only English language videos that were less than 20. min in length and primarily focused on IBD. Those with no sound/poor sound quality were excluded. More than 30 variables were analyzed. Results: Adults of 45-54. years old (95.1%) comprised the most common age group of viewers. Forty-eight percent of videos focused on Crohn's disease (CD), 32.0% on ulcerative colitis (UC), and 20.0% on both. Overall content for patient education was poor. Videos discussing alternative treatment options were more likely to depict patients' personal experience (73.9% vs. 2.4%) (p < 0.001) and be an advertisement compared to patient education videos (78.3% vs. 0) (p < 0.001). Videos discussing patient education had a higher number of favorites (mean 25.0 vs. 5.5) (p < 0.001), comments (mean 22.0 vs. 5.0) (p < 0.022) and ""likes"" (mean 19.0 vs. 9.0) (p = 0.025) than the ones discussing alternative treatment options. Conclusions: YouTube® videos on IBD are popular but a poor source of patient education.

For energy effective operations, Vdd is an important parameter in any meaningful system control mechanism. Reliable and accurate on-chip voltage sensors are therefore indispensible for the power and computation management of such systems. Existing voltage sensing methods are not suitable because they usually require a stable and known reference (voltage, current, time, frequency, etc.), which is difficult to obtain in this environment. This paper describes an autonomous reference-free voltage sensor designed using an asynchronous counter powered by the charge on a capacitor and a small controller. Unlike existing methods, the voltage information is directly generated as a digital code.

Strangely, despite the well-recognized importance of antioxidants, currently there is no international standard index for labeling owing to the lack of standardized methods for antioxidant measurement in complex products. Here, an online high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based method to detect and measure the total antioxidant capacity of antioxidant samples is presented. In this approach, complex samples containing antioxidants are separated by the HPLC system, which is further coupled to an antioxidant measuring system consisting of an optical oxygen sensor, laccase, and tetramethoxy azobismethylene quinone (TMAMQ). The antioxidants, separated via HPLC, reduce TMAMQ to syringaldazine, which is then reoxidized by laccase while simultaneously consuming O2. The amount of consumed oxygen is directly proportional to the concentration of antioxidants and is measured by the optical oxygen sensor. The sensor is fabricated by coating a glass capillary with an oxygen-sensitive thin layer made of platinum(II) meso-tetra(4-fluorophenyl)tetrabenzoporphyrin and polystyrene, which makes real-time analysis possible (t 90 = 1.1 s in solution). Four selected antioxidants (3 mM), namely, catechin, ferulic acid, naringenin (used as a control), and Trolox, representing flavonol, hydrocinnamic acid, flavanone, and vitamin E, respectively, were injected into the online antioxidant monitoring system, separated, and then mixed with the TMAMQ/laccase solution, which resulted in oxygen consumption. This study shows that, with the use of such a system, the antioxidant activity of individual antioxidant molecules in a sample and their contribution to the total antioxidant activity of the sample can be correctly assigned. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Antioxidant; Online measurements; Optical oxygen sensor; Tetramethoxy azobismethylene quinone/syringaldazine","Anti-oxidant activities; Antioxidant molecules; International standards; On-line measurement; On-line monitoring and measurement; Optical oxygen sensors; Tetramethoxy azobismethylene quinone/syringaldazine; Total antioxidant capacity; Antioxidants; Enzymes; Flavonoids; High performance liquid chromatography; Organic compounds; Oxygen; Oxygen sensors; Polystyrenes; Separation; Agents; antioxidant; fungal protein; laccase; oxygen; article; chemistry; enzymology; equipment; evaluation; genetic procedures; high performance liquid chromatography; methodology; oxidation reduction reaction; Trametes; Antioxidants; Biosensing Techniques; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Fungal Proteins; Laccase; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Trametes; Tetra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878294434

A large observational survey design was used to assess general knowledge of the brain and neuromyths. The sample comprised 242 primary and secondary school teachers who were interested in the neuroscience of learning. It would be of concern if neuromyths were found in this sample, as these teachers may want to use these incorrect interpretations of neuroscience findings in their teaching practice. Participants completed an online survey containing 32 statements about the brain and its influence on learning, of which 15 were neuromyths. Additional data was collected regarding background variables (e.g., age, sex, school type). Results showed that on average, teachers believed 49% of the neuromyths, particularly myths related to commercialized educational programs. Around 70% of the general knowledge statements were answered correctly. Teachers who read popular science magazines achieved higher scores on general knowledge questions. More general knowledge also predicted an increased belief in neuromyths. These findings suggest that teachers who are enthusiastic about the possible application of neuroscience findings in the classroom find it difficult to distinguish pseudoscience from scientific facts. Possessing greater general knowledge about the brain does not appear to protect teachers from believing in neuromyths. This demonstrates the need for enhanced interdisciplinary communication to reduce such misunderstandings in the future and establish a successful collaboration between neuroscience and education. © 2012 Dekker, Lee, Howard-Jones and Jolles.","Educational neuroscience; Neuromyths; Predictors; Prevalence; Teachers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870945517

Consequently, much of the health-related information and advice available online is inaccurate and/or misleading. Scores of medical institution Web sites are for organizations that do not exist and more than 90% of online pharmacy Web sites are fraudulent. In addition to monetary losses exacted on unsuspecting users, these fake medical Web sites have severe public safety ramifications. According to a World Health Organization report, approximately half the drugs sold on the Web are counterfeit, resulting in thousands of deaths. In this study, we propose an adaptive learning algorithm called recursive trust labeling (RTL). RTL uses underlying content and graph-based classifiers, coupled with a recursive labeling mechanism, for enhanced detection of fake medical Web sites. The proposed method was evaluated on a test bed encompassing nearly 100 million links between 930,000Web sites, including 1,000 known legitimate and fake medical sites. The experimental results revealed that RTL was able to significantly improve fake medical Web site detection performance over 19 comparison content and graph-based methods, various meta-learning techniques, and existing adaptive learning approaches, with an overall accuracy of over 94%. Moreover, RTL was able to attain high performance levels even when the training dataset composed of as little as 30 Web sites. With the increased popularity of eHealth and Health 2.0, the results have important implications for online trust, security, and public safety. © 2012 ACM.",,"Adaptive learning; Adaptive learning algorithm; Ehealth; Graph-based; Graph-based methods; Medical institutions; Meta-learning techniques; Online trust; Performance level; Public safety; Site detection; Training dataset; World Health Organization; Equipment testing; Health; Learning algorithms; Websites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871254978

Correcting misperceptions by providing feedback has been shown to be an effective intervention for reducing licit drug use. It is currently unknown if social norms interventions are effective in preventing and reducing illicit drug use in European students. The purpose of this paper is to describe the design of a multi-site cluster controlled trial of a web-based social norms intervention aimed at reducing licit and preventing illicit drug use in European university students. Methods/Design. An online questionnaire to assess rates of drug use will be developed and translated based on existing social norms surveys. Students from sixteen universities in seven participating European countries will be invited to complete the questionnaire. Both intervention and control sites will be chosen by convenience. In each country, the intervention site will be the university that the local principal investigator is affiliated with. We aim to recruit 1000 students per site (baseline assessment). All participants will complete the online questionnaire at baseline. Baseline data will be used to develop social norms messages that will be included in a web-based intervention. The intervention group will receive individualized social norms feedback. The website will remain online during the following 5 months. After five months, a second survey will be conducted and effects of the intervention on social norms and drug use will be measured in comparison to the control site. Discussion. This project is the first cross-national European collaboration to investigate the feasibility of a social norms intervention to reduce licit and prevent illicit drug use among European university students.

The method relies on using a parameterized behavioral model implemented on FPGA, whose parameters values are adaptively tuned, based on the response to test pseudo-random actuation of the physical structure. Dedicated comb drives actuate the movable mass with binary maximum length pseudo-random sequences of small amplitude, to keep the device within the linear operating regime. The frequency of the stimulus is chosen within the mechanical spectral operating range of the micro-device, such that the induced response leads to the identification of the mechanical transfer function, and to the tuning of the associated digital behavioral model. In case of a micro-gyroscope, experimental results demonstrate the adaptive tracking of the damping coefficient from 5.57×10-5 Kg/s to 7.12×10 -5 Kg/s and of the stiffness coefficient from132N/m to 137.7N/m. In the case of a MEMS accelerometer, the damping and stiffness coefficients are correctly tracked from 3.4×10-3Kg/s and 49.56N/m to 4.57× 10-3Kg/s and 51.48N/m, respectively - the former values are designer-specified target values, while the latter are experimentally measured parameters for fabricated devices operating in a real environment.

Personalised normative feedback (PNF) aims to correct this misperception by providing information about personal drinking levels and patterns compared with norms in similar aged peer groups. PNF is intended to raise motivation for behaviour change and has been highlighted for alcohol misuse prevention by the British Government Behavioural Insight Team. The objective of the trial was to assess the effectiveness of PNF with college students for the prevention of alcohol misuse. Methodology: Solomon three-group randomised controlled trial. 1751 students, from 22 British Universities, allocated to a PNF group, a normal control group, or a delayed measurement control group to allow assessment of any measurement effects. PNF was provided by email. Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline, 6- and 12-months (only 12-months for the delayed measurement controls). Drinking behaviour measures were (i) alcohol disorders; (ii) frequency; (iii) typical quantity, (iv) weekly consumption; (v) alcohol-related problems; (vi) perceived drinking norms; and (vii) positive alcohol expectancies. Analyses focused on high-risk drinkers, as well as all students, because of research evidence for the prevention paradox in student drinkers. Principal Findings: Follow-up rates were low, with only 50% and 40% responding at 6- and 12-months, respectively, though comparable to similar European studies. We found no evidence for any systematic attrition bias. Overall, statistical analyses with the high risk sub-sample, and for all students, showed no significant effects of the intervention, at either time-point, in a completed case analysis and a multiple imputation analysis. Conclusions: We found no evidence for the effectiveness of PNF for the prevention of alcohol misuse and alcohol-related problems in a UK student population.

Geoscientists have significant roles to play, more particularly in the field of geohazards, to appraise society about the possibilities of natural hazards such as landslides, avalanches, floods, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Geoscientists cannot only assess these hazards, but they can also estimate the potential consequences if these hazards occur in a given place and at a given time. However, sometimes it has been found that the credibility of geoscientists among society and government is lost, due to some unethical practices for shortterm gain, or due to incorrect understanding of geological phenomena. Some of the hazards that cannot be predicted with the existing capabilities have been forecast by some pseudo-geoscientists, to draw social/media attention, thereby bringing the reputation of the profession into disrepute. There is the need to be fair enough to accept the limitations of our profession in providing information about natural hazards that are not yet fully understood by the professionals themselves. More specifically, the predictions related to earthquakes have drawn the attention of society as well as media in the developing countries where the 'common' people have different perceptions. Most often, popular myths take over scientific facts among the public, and this can lead to rumors about natural hazards. This article will mention some cases of rumors about natural disasters, and particularly earthquakes, and the response of society, media and government. It emphasizes the role of geoscientists as the ethical responsibility to inform the public about the actual situations and the geohazards, to avoid panic caused by rumors from nonspecialists or hyperactive pseudo experts.

The mixing and segregation phenomenon occur in most systems of granular solids and have a significant influence on the quality and outcome of the final product. The usual approach to mix the powders is by using a tumbling blender which rotates around one axis, where, the radial convection is reported to be faster than axial dispersion transport, hindering the mixing performance. A double cone mixer is fabricated which rotates around two axes, causing axial mixing competitive to its radial counterpart. Samples are collected intrusively using the discrete pocket samplers to quantify the characteristics of mixing for millimeter sized glass beads. Digital video recording and MATLAB based image analysis techniques are used for non-intrusive characterization of mixing in micron sized art sands. A parametric study of the effect of particle size, vessel speeds on the granular mixing is accomplished. Incorporation of dual axis rotation enhances axial mixing by 70-90% in comparison to single axis rotation. Particles of smaller sizes (art sand) tend to mix quicker than the bigger particles (glass beads) due to mild cohesive effects. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Granular mixing; Image analysis; Powder flow; Rotary mixer; Sampling","Axial dispersions; Axial-mixing; Digital video recording; Dual axis; Glass bead; Granular mixing; Granular segregation; Granular solids; Image analysis techniques; Industrial product; Mixing and segregations; Mixing performance; Non-intrusive; Parametric study; Powder Flow; Radial convection; Single-axis; Vessel speed; Blending; Granular materials; Image analysis; Mixers (machinery); Sampling; Segregation (metallography); Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861713083

The speckle patterns are fabricated by directly etching the counterpart of the specimen to the black part of a template. Mean intensity gradient is used to evaluate the quality of these SEM images of speckle patterns fabricated based on different templates to select an optimum template. The pattern size depending on the displacement measurement sensitivity is adjusted by altering the magnification of FIB according to the relation curve of the etching size versus magnification.

The present study investigated family planning providers' attitudes and considerations when recommending family planning methods and LARCs to clients. Additionally, this study explored whether urban-rural differences exist in providers' attitudes toward LARCs and in clients' use of LARCs. Methods: Data were collected using an online survey of family planning providers at Title X clinics in Texas. Survey data was linked to family planning client data from the Family Planning Annual Report (2008). Results: Findings indicated that, although providers were aware of the advantages of LARCs, clients' LARC use remains infrequent. Providers reported that the benefits of hormone implants include their effectiveness for 3 years and that they are an option for women who cannot take estrogen-based birth control. Providers acknowledged the benefits of several types of LARCs; however, urban providers were more likely to acknowledge the benefits of hormone implants compared with their rural counterparts. Results also indicated barriers to recommending LARCs, such as providers' misinformation about LARCs and their caution in recommending LARCs to adolescents. However, findings also indicated providers lack training in LARC insertion, specifically among those practicing in rural areas. Conclusions: In light of the effectiveness and longevity of LARCs, teenagers and clients living in rural areas are ideal LARC candidates. Increased training among family planning providers, especially for those practicing in rural areas, may increase their recommendations of LARCs to clients. © 2012 Jacobs Institute of Women's Health.",,"adult; article; clinical practice; contraception; controlled study; family planning; female; health care access; health care cost; health care utilization; health disparity; health personnel attitude; health survey; hormonal contraception; human; intrauterine contraceptive device; male; medical education; public health problem; risk benefit analysis; social status; United States; urban rural difference; Adolescent; Adult; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Attitude of Health Personnel; Contraception; Contraceptive Agents; Delayed-Action Preparations; Family Planning Services; Female; Health Care Surveys; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Rural Population; Texas; Urban Population; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857691532

We reviewed material posted in virtual communities by self-identified clinical trial participants. We identified material posted in online health forums that could introduce bias into clinical research studies; we believe that this issue warrants further study and discussion. Physicians and others who conduct clinical trials should be aware of this issue. Study investigators and research teams should also talk to their study subjects about where and how they are obtaining information in order to prevent behaviors and correct misinformation that could put a subject's safety or the study objectives at risk.

Compared with bulky Geiger-M̈uller-type proportional counters, semiconductor-based radiation detectors, particularly those using compound semiconductors, have drawn considerable recent interest due to their scope for miniaturization. CdS is a highly sensitive II-VI compound semiconductor whose internal resistance changes on exposure to X-rays and is capable of absorbing green light in the range of 2.5 - 3.5 eV (490 - 511 nm). Despite its slow response compared with amorphous selenium, it has several advantages for digital radiography because of its low voltage requirements, high X-ray sensitivity, and high absorption coefficient. In this study, the X-ray detection characteristics of a CdS photocell were evaluated for use in an economical, portable X-ray dosimeter. A CdS photocell with a thickness of 20 μm was fabricated by using thermal evaporation, and the ratio of its photocurrent to its dark current was found to be on the order of 105 with a maximum allowed power consumption of over 80 mW. The cell was incorporated into a prototype X-ray dosimeter system with an 8051 microprocessor, used to measure the output voltage characteristics of the CdS cell for various tube voltages, tube currents, and exposure times. The experimental results confirmed good linearity with tube voltage and current, but a delayed response. The results of this study can be used as the basis for the design of accurate, economical, and portable X-ray dosimeters.","CdS; X-ray detector; X-ray sensitivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-83455179650

However, that augmentation can mislead if it is done incorrectly and not within reasonable limits. When procedures are in place for ensuring that originals are archived, and image manipulation steps are reported, scientists not only follow good laboratory practices, but also avoid ethical issues associated with postprocessing and protect their labs from any future allegations of scientific misconduct. Also, when procedures are in place for correct acquisition of images, the extent of postprocessing is minimized or eliminated. These procedures include color balancing (for brighfield images), keeping tonal values within the dynamic range of the detector, frame averaging to eliminate noise (typically in fluorescence imaging), use of the highest bit depth when a choice is available, flatfield correction, and archiving of the image in a nonlossy format (not JPEG). When postprocessing is necessary, the commonly used applications for correction include Photoshop, and ImageJ, but a free program (GIMP) can also be used. Corrections to images include scaling the bit depth to higher and lower ranges, removing color casts from brightfield images, setting brightness and contrast, reducing color noise, reducing ""grainy"" noise, conversion of pure colors to grayscale, conversion of grayscale to colors typically used in fluorescence imaging, correction of uneven illumination and flatfield correction, blending color images (fluorescence), and extending the depth of focus.

In this study, we examined whether providing information that counters these concerns might impact on intentions to use NRT. Participants: 900 smokers recruited from a market research database. Design and setting: Participants completed an online survey that asked about their views about NRT. Smokers with safety and efficacy concerns were queried to determine whether accurate information might increase their interest in using NRT. Findings: Misperceptions of NRT safety were common: 93% of smokers did not know that smoking while wearing the nicotine patch does not cause heart attacks; 76% that nicotine gum/lozenge are not as addictive as cigarettes; and 69% that NRT products are not as dangerous as cigarettes. Over half of the smokers with misperceptions reported that they would be more likely to use NRT to help them quit smoking if they were exposed to information correcting their concerns (53%, 58% and 66%, respectively, for each of the misperceptions). Conclusions: These data suggest that while a sizeable proportion of smokers are still misinformed about the safety of NRT, misinformed smokers would increase consideration of NRT if these misperceptions are addressed by corrective information. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Misperceptions; Nicotine; Nicotine replacement therapy; NRT; Smoking cessation","nicotine gum; nicotine patch; adult; article; cigarette smoking; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; heart infarction; human; lozenge; major clinical study; male; neoplasm; nicotine replacement therapy; patient information; patient safety; smoking cessation; Adult; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Information Dissemination; Male; Nicotine; Nicotinic Agonists; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79954969716

This novel architecture is designed to provide a wide operating frequency range, high precision, and small jitter, and fits over a relatively small area. To achieve these characteristics, the architecture is implemented using a coarse loop with an UP/DOWN counter and a coarse digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to rapidly reduce the phase error, and a fine loop with a time-to-digital converter (TDC) and a fine DAC to provide more precision. Furthermore, the seamless-frequency tracking architecture based on a code conversion between the coarse cell and the fine cell of the DAC is devised to improve the lock-in stability.

Box 2250, Haifa 31021, Israel","Since the late 1990s Semiconductor devices (SCDs) has developed and manufactured a variety of InSb two-dimensional (2D) focal plane arrays (FPAs) that were implemented in many infrared (IR) systems and applications. SCD routinely manufactures both analog and digital InSb FPAs with array formats of 320×256, 480×384, and 640×512 elements, and pitch size in the range 15 to 30 μm. These FPAs are available in many packaging configurations, including fully integrated detector-Dewarcooler-assembly, with either closed-cycle Stirling or open-loop Joule-Thomson coolers. In response to a need for very high resolution midwave IR (MWIR) detectors and systems, SCD has developed a large format 2D InSb detector with 1280×1024 elements and pixel size of 15 μm. The ROIC is fabricated in CMOS 0.18-μm technology, that enables the small pixel circuitry and relatively low power generation at the focal plane. The digital ROIC has an analog to digital (A/D) converter per-channel and allows for full frame readout at a rate of 100 Hz. Such on-chip A/D conversion eliminates the need for several A/D converters with fairly high power consumption at the system level. The digital readout, together with the InSb detector technology, lead to a wide linear dynamic range and low residual nonuniformity, which is stable over a long period of time following a nonuniformity correction procedure. A special Dewar was designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions while minimizing the contribution to the heat load of the detector. The Dewar together with the low power ROIC, enable a megapixel detector with overall low size, weight, and power with respect to comparable large format detectors. A variety of applications with this detector make use of different cold shields with different f-number and spectral filters. In this paper we present actual performance characteristics of the megapixel InSb detector and demonstrate its high manufacturability. © 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","detector Dewar cooler; focal plane array; infrared fetector; InSb; modulation transfer function; readout integrated circuit","A/D conversion; A/D converter; Analog to digital converters; Closed cycle; Cold shield; Digital readouts; Environmental conditions; Focal Plane; Fully integrated; High power consumption; InSb; InSb detector; Joule-Thomson coolers; Large format; Linear dynamic ranges; Low Power; Low-size; M-Technologies; Manufacturability; Mega-pixel; Mid-wave IR; Midwave infrared; Nonuniformity; Nonuniformity Correction; On chips; Open loops; Performance characteristics; Pixel size; Readout integrated circuits; Spectral filters; Stirling; System levels; Very high resolution; Analog to digital conversion; Chip scale packages; Cooling systems; Dewars; Digital devices; Focal plane arrays; Focusing; Indium antimonides; Infrared radiation; Low power electronics; Optical transfer function; Pixels; Semiconductor devices; Thermography (imaging); Detectors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81755178961

Since the imaging detectors are fabricated by semiconductor manufacturing process over large areas, defective pixels in the detectors are unavoidable. Moreover, the radiation damage due to the routine use of the detectors progressively increases the density of defective pixels. In this study, we present a method of identifying defective pixels in digital radiography detectors based on wavelet analysis. Artifacts generated due to wavelet transformations have been prevented by an additional local threshold method. The proposed method was applied to a sample digital radiography and the result was promising. The proposed method uses a single pair of dark and white images and does not require them to be corrected in gain-and-offset properties. This method will be helpful for the reliable use of digital radiography detectors through the working lifetime. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Techniques based on the direct observation of the pore system (optical and scanning electron microscopes, digital image analysis) were combined with others used for indirect characterization (mercury intrusion porosimetry, N2 adsorption, hydric tests, and vapour permeability). In addition, we performed accelerated decay tests to determine the durability of the stones and to check the consistency of the results obtained in the pore system study. Digital image analysis allowed us to calculate the pore size distribution and the total porosity. Digital image analysis always gave higher values for total porosity than those determined by porosimetry and hydric tests, which only measure open porosity. The density values were congruent with the mineralogy of the stones. The stone that obtained the best results in the various tests in terms of its petrophysical parameters was dolostone, while the worst performance was by one of the two limestones. These results were confirmed by the decay tests. The combined use of these different techniques gave us an accurate interpretation of the pore systems of the six different stones, and also enabled us to correct misleading interpretations caused by the limitations of using one single technique. Our findings also provide useful information to help prevent the decay of these stones. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Accelerated decay tests; Pore system characterization; Sedimentary stones","Image analysis; Lime; Limestone; Minerals; Pore size; Scanning electron microscopy; Sedimentology; Decay tests; Digital image analysis; Direct observations; Mercury intrusion porosimetry; Petrophysical parameters; Pore system; Sedimentary stones; Total porosity; Durability; adsorption; construction material; digital image; dolostone; durability; limestone; permeability; pore space; porosity; sandstone; sedimentary rock; size distribution; travertine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952249497

Especially in patients with implanted cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD), they are well established and their usefulness and reliability have been shown in several clinical trials. Currently, three generations of Home Monitoring™ (HM, Biotronik GmbH & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany) are commercially available. Methods: This paper presents three cases demonstrating the various limitations of the first and second generations of HM and the way they can be overcome by the third generation. Results: In the first case, atrial flutter was misinterpreted by the device and classified as ventricular tachycardia (VT). Thus, in the online IEGM, supraventricular tachycardia was identified, and the short IEGM strip and lack of transmitted atrial signals of the dual-chamber device necessitated an appointment for ICD interrogation, to clarify the diagnosis and propose further treatment. The second case is that of a patient in whom a VT was ineffectively treated by anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) and continued with longer cycle length, leading to syncope. A second-generation HM device with online-IEGM misleadingly appears to indicate successful treatment. The third case demonstrates correct detection and therapy of a fast VT by an ICD of third-generation HM type. The online IEGM now gives all information needed for complete telemetric assessment. Conclusions: Home Monitoring (HM) is a helpful remote surveillance tool for the early detection of both arrhythmias and technical problems. As shown, the first two generations had limitations which the patient must take into account when using the system. These limitations have been overcome in the third generation, making Home Monitoring more self-sufficient and reliable. ©2010, Editrice Kurtis.","Home monitoring; ICD; Ineffective therapy; Limitations","amiodarone; antitachycardia pacing; article; cardiomyopathy; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary stent; defibrillator; electrocardiography monitoring; heart arrhythmia; heart atrium fibrillation; heart atrium flutter; heart infarction; heart pacing; heart ventricle tachycardia; home monitoring; human; online monitoring; supraventricular tachycardia; syncope; telemetry; Defibrillators, Implantable; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; Humans; Tachycardia, Ventricular; Telemetry; Syncope",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955414666

RSFQ is outstanding because of its very low switching energy resulting in very low power consumption. This advantage causes, however, a significant influence of thermal noise. For industrial applications, a certain noise immunity is required which is still a challenge, especially for circuits of higher complexity. Integrating phase-shifting elements is a new concept for further improvements concerning stability against the influence of thermal noise. We have already shown that the implementation of phase-shifting elements significantly reduces the influence of thermal noise on circuit behavior by experimentally analyzing the bit-error rate (Mielke, et al. 2009 IEEE Trans. Appl. Supercond. 19 621-5). Concepts which are easily implementable in standard niobium technology are especially promising. The π-phaseshifter consists of a superconducting loop which is able to store a single flux quantum. The loop current related to the stored flux creates a well-defined phase shift. To achieve the correct functionality of complex circuits it is essential to store exactly one flux quantum in each π-phaseshifter during the cooling down of the chip. Thus, for studying the feasibility of this new approach, the initialization reliability of the π-phaseshifter needs to be verified. We present an experimental investigation of this reliability to obtain a general assessment for the application of the π-phaseshifter in niobium technology. Furthermore, we compare the configuration shielded by a solid ground plane with a configuration with a ground-plane hole below the π-phaseshifter. Justified by the experimental results we suggest programmable RSFQ circuits based on π-phaseshifters. The characteristics of these devices can be influenced by a controlled initialization of the π-phaseshifter.

Adequate dissemination of correct information about H1N1 influenza could help in decreasing the disease spread and associated anxiety in the population. Purpose: This study aims to examine the effective use of the popular Internet video site YouTube as an information source during the initial phase of the H1N1 outbreak. Methods: YouTube was searched on June 26, 2009, using the keywords swine flu, H1N1 influenza, and influenza for videos uploaded in the past 3 months containing relevant information about the disease. The videos were classified as useful, misleading, or as news updates based on the kind of information contained. Total viewership, number of days since upload, total duration of videos, and source of upload were noted. Results: A total of 142 videos had relevant information about H1N1 influenza. In all, 61.3% of videos had useful information about the disease, whereas 23% were misleading. Total viewership share of useful videos was 70.5%, whereas that of misleading videos was 17.5%, with no significant difference in viewership/day. The CDC contributed about 12% of the useful videos, with a significant viewership share of 47%. No significant differences were seen in viewership/day for useful videos based on the kind of information they contained.

These are not imaginary threats but are supported by empirical evidence. This wastes time to users opening spam with misleading subject lines, wastes Internet resources trying to block it, consumes storage and bandwidth, and costs money in fighting it. E-commerce cannot flourish in an uncertain environment where security of personal data is not guaranteed. With the aim of boosting confidence in online commerce and protecting the interests of consumers, governments have introduced anti-spam legislation to protect consumers and businesses. This legislation has introduced different parameters. However, legislation alone cannot prevent spam. It is to be combined with technological measures. There is no separate legislation in India to deal with this problem. This paper analyses technological solutions and legal measures in the light of trans-national developments to provide background for any judicial decision making or legislative policy in India. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Anti- spam laws; Anti-spam procedures; Anti-spam protocols; Autonomy theory; Home theory; Spam; Spam filters",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77951934675

With the development of transparent organic thin film transistors, there is a need to also develop memory devices to allow the complete integration of digital circuitries. The aim of this research is to develop a fabrication route of an all-solution processing of optically transparent organic field effect transistor-based non-volatile memory (OFET-NVM). The OFET-NVMs can be programmed and erased at a relatively low voltage (±15 V). The OFET-NVM has a charge mobility of 0.125 cm 2/V-s, threshold voltage shift of approximately 3 V between programmed and erased transistor and a sub-threshold slope of 1.5 V/decade. Although these figure-of-merits are not comparable to its silicon counterpart, the creation of an all solution processed OFET-NVM that is optically transparent (~70-85%) has been demonstrated. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Charge mobilities; Digital circuitry; Fabrication routes; Low voltages; Memory device; Non-volatile memories; Nonvolatile memory devices; Organic thin film transistors; Organic transistor; Solution-processed; Solution-processing; Subthreshold; Threshold voltage shifts; ZnO; Digital devices; Field effect transistors; Industrial research; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Thin film transistors; Threshold voltage; Zinc oxide; Organic field effect transistors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949275270

The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate Canadian attitudes around the safety of the H1N1 vaccine during the fall 2009 influenza pandemic and (2) to consider how public health communications can leverage the Internet to counteract, in real time, anti-vaccine sentiment. We surveyed a random sample of 175,257 Canadian web users from October 27 to November 19, 2009, about their perceptions of the safety of the HINI vaccine. In an independent analysis, we also assessed the popularity of online flu vaccine-related information using a tool developed for this purpose. A total of 27,382 unique online participants answered the survey (15.6% response rate). Of the respondents, 23.4% considered the vaccine safe, 41.4% thought it was unsafe and 35.2% reported ambivalence over its safety. Websites and blog posts with anti-vaccine sentiment remained popular during the course of the pandemic. Current public health communication and education strategies about the flu vaccine can be complemented by web analytics that identify, track and neutralize anti-vaccine sentiment on the Internet, thus increasing perceived vaccine safety. Counter-marketing strategies can be transparent and collaborative, engaging online ""influencers"" who spread misinformation.",,"influenza vaccine; adolescent; adult; aged; article; Canada; female; health care survey; human; immunology; influenza; Influenza virus A H1N1; Internet; male; middle aged; patient attitude; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Canada; Female; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952199376
